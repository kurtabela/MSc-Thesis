about the store
this site aims to deliver modern and contemporary poetry to a wider audience.
from school students to students of a much more advanced level, from a Maltese language study for those who simply take a pleasure read in Maltese and want to know more about how the poetic tradition is shaping.
apart from the poems themselves, here you should find the reading of some poems, both from the poets themselves and by actors, photographs of poets taken in important moments in their lives, manuscripts, and even articles and interviews with poets.
the project is still in the research phase, and then the material is only a representative sample of Maltese poets and their works.
we hope that at a reading time we have everyone on this site.
note on the use of Maltese: due to the way the WordPress works, the motor operating on this site, it is not possible to have any choice or written message in Maltese unless the WordPress framework has translated: a large piece of work involving thousands of phrases.
some efforts have already been made to do so, but it appears that we are still far away from having a version of the WordPress completely in Maltese.

"to switch to a hydroponic system was advantageous and ideal for me because my window is not very great.
this technology has been allowed to increase a considerable number of vegetables in a restricted space.
since I have started using the hydroponmic system, I have eliminated the need to change herbal, and maximise water use through a continuous cycle.
by investing in this system I have benefited from more financial gain by reducing water use. "
Louis Mifsud,
by St John
Louis Mifsud from St John is making good use of at his home to reduce water consumption from the Government system.
"I' ve left in this house 30 years ago and from the first I realized that I can make use of the small bitter I had to save water.
so I decided to collect rain water instead of being lost.
we single pump in the beer and day when the beer is filled, especially in winter months, turn the pump and use water for moneyhing.
in the months where rainfall is less, use the beer to belly plants, instead of using water from vitamin.
I found these solutions easy to use them and keep them and save water all these years. "

the Mgarr may be the most village cut in Malta.
away from any other locality, he maintained its distinct character and serenity.
his coastline extends from Fomm the village to the Bay of Għajn Tuffieħa and between these are the painted beach of Our Lady.
protected beaches such as our Gnna and Għajntuffieħa during the centuries were places of refuge for pirates and because this, several towers were built on the last of the Mgarr.
one of the existing ones is the Lippija Torres who built the Grand Master Lascaris in 1657 to protect the Gnnana and the few families living in Mgarr.
Mġarr became a parish in 1893 when the population was about 700.
before this, he was part of the parish of Mosta since 1610.
the first priest was Monsignor Glormu Chetcuti who was the foundations of one of the most impressive churches on the island.
contributions to build the church included 5, 700 birds, 920 pigs, 620 rabbits, 600 lambs and goats, 13 calves and 360,000 white.
the Church has built it with the form of white and the oval design is not so perfect it was so unusual that no architect had the courage to design before Jamri Camilleri - the beloved and Mr John A Cilia the surmast that vague to do the work that ended to be headed
village people are totally devote to their patrons - The Holy Virgin.
Mary dominates the araldic mention of the parish that was designed by the so loved Salomone that served as a parish priest from 1931 to 1954.
the village feast is celebrated in the first place after 15 August.
carrying the statue during procession is such a honour that the purchaser promises and offers that are then distributed among charitable institutions and mission and so on go to the maintenance of the church.
Mġarr has some of the oldest places of worship.
the Skorba temples, consisting of two distinct temples, are so old that they have been entered in Guinness Book of Records as one of the oldest two fine structures in the world.
the Western temple entrusted to about 3500 BC is about 60 square feet.
it is built on a plan in the form of three heels with a thirteen apsidi chambers and salting in the middle.
some of the yarns have a thickness of four piirs.
the Eastern temple is not so old nor is it well preserved.
another important set of megaltic structures is located in Tajiaġrat.
this consists of two temples and the basic form is also of a plan in the form of three heirs and a central odour.
the biggest temple has a great spectacular top.
around the village are located in the district channels.
not so old are the Thermal Roman Baths near Għajntuffieħa.
these baths were part of a villa including statue and amfori.
strong members of Roman families in a high position were frequently Malta and used this villa as a place of rest in their way to colonies on the coast of North Africa.
the Southern Carriage border is formed by the Great Ridge and Victoria Lines, fortified wall of the 19 th century.
Victoria Lines was completed in 1897, the year of the diamond Jubilee of the Queen Victoria.
this long stretch is marked with watch towers, batteries, canon places and various fortities.
there are four forests with this wall, Fort Madliena, Fort Mosta, Binger named Fort and Fort Pembroke.
the Municipal Offices are at the top of the Parish Church and on 1 February 1994 the first Council was established.
the Council is composed of Mayor, Vice - Mayor and three councillors.
the person passing through this small village is sure to be welcomed with a smile.
the Council is working very much to maintain the integrity, serenity and character of the village for which the "small" motto is well founded with a great heart. "

seven results for Malta and Gozo
since joining the European Union Malta took a huge step forward.
however, membership alone is not a guarantee in itself.
we need to use EU tools correctly to our advantage.
I, Peter Agius, pledge to work hard to deliver these 7 concrete results to you starting from the first year of my work, if you trust me with your vote:
those who feed us.
I will promote Maltese produce and Maltese producers.
farmers, Fish Chairman and livestock breeders cannot continue to be expected to follow EU rules without Reaping any reward.
Youths and opportunities.
our ambition must be that each and every Maltese and Gozitan youth exploits Erasmus + for work, traineeships, studying abroad, an experience which enriches us personally and as a nation.
Maltese competitiveness.
innovation, industry and EU funds.
we can benefit much more from EU funds (including direct funds) by investing more on research and innovation.
I will take a strong position against European taxes which would undermine our competitiveness in areas such as financial services and Gaming.
public service employees.
I already presented proposals for more autonomy and meritocracy in the public sector.
I will make sure that these will be implemented by acting as a shield for public service officials and public service in general.
our identity in Europe.
our Christian values, our language, passoft (including hunting and trapping) and our traditions.
Europe must embrace Maltese identity and not impose a cap that does not fit us.
small businesses and entrepreneurship.
we joined the EU for just and fair I will fight against practices by government and external actors which distort competition.
I will do my utmost to truly represent small businesses and entrepreneurs in Brussels.
immigration.
Malta is still exposed to the risks of irregular immigration in thousands from Africa.
I will work to ensure that Europe shows true solidarity on this issue and I will insist on the application of rules in the case of those who do not have the right to stay in Malta by being returned in a safe environment.
Vision My
agriculture
agriculture needs to be raised in government priorities - our own food depends on it.
with Malta' s entry into the European Union Maltese farming has been exposed to competition with the foreign product.
this is good per se, but not when the farmer is allowed for re - accession, without any guidance and assistance, with European funds lasting one year and a half years are processed and with a testing system for pesticides that punish the Maltese product in you see how to protect the consumer.
we as consumers and as Maltese we have to rely on our head that we have a fresh Maltese product available.
it is not a good idea to rely inter alia on food imports.
in the past ten years we import 70% of our fruit and vegetables.
with little attention we will redouble the Maltese priority farming.
we see strengthening the Maltese product by helping producer organisations to promote the Maltese product.
there are also ways to help Europe in this, which will elaborate them in the coming weeks.
education, Youth, Teachers
Europe has a immense space of opportunity, especially for young people who want to explore the world and to use all experience to open the life perspectives.
the European Erasmus + programme needs to be used much better by the Government and the private sector in Malta for this purpose.
Malta has an average participation rate in Erasmus +.
for every teacher we have sent Malta, Cyprus and Iceland three, for each Maltese student on a traineeship they send him two.
we can be more pronounced, especially when it considers that for us as an island country it is more and more important to take experiences abroad.
our young people ready for adventure, we must be there to make it possible.
now Erasmus + also allows teachers not only to go on learning experience abroad but also to submit projects in primary and secondary schools to their school.
to make this new tool a success we want to courage and give an incentive to teachers, we don' t share their heart with Maltese internal red tape.
European opportunities in this area are too big to leave them going on.
Gozo and the European Funds
Gozo has returned more than our villages in the Union.
the services, Gaming, conserving and others did not approach Gozo.
despite producing the highest number of graduates, they often need to leave Malta or abroad to find a deny work of their qualifications.
solutions for Gozo are not simple, but there are few things that can start change.
we start from European funds.
they are not sufficient to devote 10% of them for Gozo.
it is necessary to be spent on the priorities of the Gozitan island, and this should not be decided Castile or Brussels but in Rabat by Gozitan itself.
at European level, Gozo requires active representation of its specific interests.
his regionality cannot continue to be used as a card in the mazz of Malta.
on the other hand, the region is not the purpose in itself, it should only be the means in which Gozo advises its case, which maintains its unique character while providing opportunities for young Gozitan people.
EU for Business and Industry
online shopping is hot selling our community' s harsh trade.
most cities and villages depend on road shops for the character and life of the community, thus helping them compete online by providing public platforms for their presence on the internet.
this is also in the interest of our consumers to appreciate broader choices.
the next EU budget envisages a fund of EUR 9,2 billion specifically designed for the digital transition of private undertakings and the adaptation of our workforce to a more digitised world.
Malta should be in the lead to exploiting this funding opportunity.
we should also ensure that competition is truly fair and free for companies participating in public procurement.
current government practices indicate systematic and excessive use of direct orders and disposal of works in large contracts.
Brussels not only a place for policy.
I use our representation at the heart of Europe to foster networks and opportunities for Maltese business, help Maltese ideas to find partners and markets on the continent.

prior to the rehabilitation of roads throughout the Church of the Chamber in 2006 by the Hamrun Local Council, there were two canons defended in the land along the same Church' s points.
that time they have been injured by Heritage Malta as a national estate.
from some adult writings that there was a large battery at the time of the French blockade, since the Maltese maintained the enemy that does not leave outside the door of bomb.
for the inhawi of the Chamber these canons had a sentimental value, other than historical value.
it was therefore that for the last few years the Hamrun Local Council thabat to return them.

18. Feb. 2011 NEW MP3' S AND AN UPDATE IN THE RELEASE Section: OK, so it' s almost a year since I updated this site.
been doing more work on Tape rape, Kassettkultur, playing and just other things taking up time.
but I' ve now updated the release site with two physical release, one which was released in May last year, and one that came a little over a month ago.
first we have the (in) famous tile by Somalia Small But Heavy (Roar Borge and Martin competell) named Tile.
the other physical release is the second box set on Ambolthue, a box with all the floppy releases by Bjerga / Iversen on Gold Sounds between 2006 and 2009 + a bonus floppy, making a total of 5 floppy' s, all Spanning about 5 minutes all together.

two new MP3 - singles are out too.
check them out for Free!

enjoy!

more reviews added to the section.
I' m also working on putting samples to all releases online and will clean up the website as the time goes by. 24. mar. 2010 YO LADIES AND gentlemen, THE NEW AMBTRASS IS here: yeah it' s true, and if you don' t believe me, see for yourself: origami Binarika - Windung Zu Selbst Mit Traum. 16. mar. 2010 NEW goodies TO GET FROM AMBOLTHUE: 3 CDRs and one MP3 release.
the first is from the guy behind the Magnificent [Ohm] Records, namely O.
Melby.
this release contains 2 live recordings and it' s titled Marsipan.
the second CDR today is dag Stiberg (Maranata, Now We Got Members, My Midnight Creeps), and it' s titled Monolithic Time.
better dark - jazz is hard to find!
the last CDR of todays releases are a singles colected release from Fisk På disc, and it' s titled Fishfingers.
this is one of the heavyest release on Ambolthue in my own opinion, and it' s good to listen to one or two tracks a day.
Strange as only the Fishy duo can make it.
then we have the MP3 release.
It' s from a new duo called Stegofon (John E.
Sandli & Håkon Nordheim), and it' s titled Eldorado Paranormal activity.
beautiful Artwork and very good music.
download for free now!
24. Feb. 2010 AMBTRASS IS Back: If you thought we forgot it, you' re wrong.
we didn' t but at origami Boe plays a Spacial concert on this very day we decided to delay the release by a month.
but finally here.
you probably guessed it already, but it' s from origami BoE, and concists of four 8 - minute tracks made on acoustic laptops in February, 2009.
It' s titled Kaptcha B.
nothing more to do now than to download this and enjoy it!
more in the months ahead in this series, and this weekend will there be two more releases out there. 23. Feb. 2010 FIRST batch OF 2010: Yes it' s finally here, the new releases of 2010.
it' s not completely true that the first release on Ambolthue is out today as it' s been a long time since I actually updated this website, and to be honest I' ve actually released two releases since the last news post.
one of them was released on december 2 nd, last year, and was a long awaited CDR.
our friend Mixturizer from Spain has done a remix EP of the (in) famous classic split- CDR between house - artist Torstein Wjiik and Swamps Up Nostrils, Øresus & Dus.
on this EP, also titled Øresus & Dus you' ll find remixes of four of the tracks found on the original.
It' s two tracks from each artist, and Mixturizer has truely done his to make it his own.
if you liked the original then you' ll love this.
on Januray 12 th, during this year' s All Ears festival, Anla Courtis (of Reynols fame) played the Festival' s probably most humouristic act and Ambolthue' s favourite act of the year.
on March 5 th, 2007, he also visited Oslo where he played a concert with local artists Kjell Runar "Killer" Jenssen (DEL, origami Arktika) and André Borgen (which also released a fantastic solo album last year) at Sound Of mu.
this was already days after the concert decided to be released on Ambolthue, but trouble with the cover and the classic form of forgetfulness has made this most delayed release so far on Ambolthue, but now it' s finally here!
it got the Suiting title Sound of Mu 5.3. 2007, and sounds amazing.
for fans of DEL and psychedelic pludering - rock in general.
and so on to the "batch," which is not really that much of a batch without the two mentioned above, but it' s two more at least.
first, a proud moment for the label- owner Kjetil Hanssen as he has finally got his first CD out on the market.
it' s a celebration of his 5 th year with the Torstein Wjiik project, and this CD is a collection of various field recordings and analogue and digital noise recordings.
it was co - released with Synesthetic Recordings in edition of 220 copies.
titled Wjiik Let Angreben Af Influenza which is quite Suiting in these times where swine flu seems to have taken over the world.
an intense and humorous journey into the fucked up head of Mr.
Wjiik (not to be confused with Kjetil Hanssen).
the last release for now comes from Cooloola Monster of Basque contry, and it' s actually their debut release.
It' s a four- piece band with Estanis Comella, Miguel A.
Garcia, Oier I.
a. and Ross MacDonald and is hard to describe as anything else but experimental improv.
to try to compare it to anything would be just stupid.
unique and extremely good music from a band you' ll probably hear more from in the future.
amounts 'O' Shanter is it' s title, and you should order a copy now!
there will also be two more releases coming this weekend, so keep your eyes open.
just need a re - fill on blank CDR' s first for the duplication process.
also updating the website in general.
samples from all releases, a Clean- up in the link section and of course a fresh mailorder is just around the corner. 24. DEC. 2009 Merry X- MAS WITH 2 NEW RELEASES: First of all a very merry Christmas to all of you.
the first release I wanna tell you about is something truely special.
the first limited MP3 - release on Ambolthue, and it' s only available throughout this Christmas.
that means that on January 1 st it will be removed, so download while you can.
this is the first of holyday related noise releases by labelhead Torstein Wjiik, and in the very distant future they all will be released on a physical format.
but as of now it' s only available on MP3 for free, but just for one week though.
it' s got the catchy title Santa dropped Average For Me, Even though I' ve Been A Bad Boy This Year, and it' s a 10 minute harsh noise piece.
enjoy the single!
the second release today is yet another freebie.
It' s the 14 th in the AMBTRASS - series, and it' s from origami South America (aka. Anla Courtis of Reynols fame).
it' s a very neat noise album recorded in 1998, and was planned to be released as part of a 10 cassette box that never got realised.
but now the finally here.
the title is Col- Rrr- Kat. 25. Nov. 2009 AMBTRASS - 13 IS here: First of all a short notice on the last place.
it said that it was a secret who played on the The Thousand Arms Of Compassion MP3 - release, but it' s not a secret anywhere.
this is the first release by Ernesto Bohorquez under his own name, and this is a pre - stage of his band- project The Thousand Arms Of Compassion.
the missunderstanding was that I thought this release was also under the band name while it was not.. well you See.
anyways, over to the new stuff.
another release in the AMBTRASS - series is here, this time a really good old piece of music from 1984. 25 years ago, Mr.
origami Boe sat down making this.
the story of it can be found on the cover, so download, burn it and listen.
static, beautyful and drony.
released as origami Storika and s called Sosial Kollaps 1984.
enjoy!
13. Nov. 2009 MORE NEW RELEASES: First of all, sorry for the delay on updating the releases that came the 10 th.
these three has been available since then, but I forgot to update the website.
but today it' s even more out.
two new releases in the card- series, and first out we have Bjerga / Iversen - Parklife, once again another more "serious" release in the card series.
it has been some strange, quite heavy releases there compared to this.
the other card is from the Magnificent Animal Machine, and it' s called U + 2623.
Harsher indeed than the Bjerga / Iversen - card, but a very interesting and nice card.
this will also be the last card in the series before the compilation will come.
but this is the only way to get the beautiful Artwork of both cards.
only 20 numbered copies as allways of each.
the last release today is yet another free MP3 - release, this time a single with the cryptic project The Thousand Arms Of Compassion with a self - titled MP3 - single.
don' t bother asking, 'cause you won' t get no information on who it is!
take a listen and guess..
I can say this much, it' s someone you should know who it is!
10. Nov. 2009 THREE NEW RELEASES: two more releases from Maranata in good 'ol cardboard - cover Style.
Maranata shows us once again that they' re masters of suspence, progression, explorations within sounds and of course variation.
los Gritos De La Hermanes De Satan is the title of the first of the two, and the second is called Sette Note In Nero.
if everything goes as planned, I' m upping samples for all the ambolthue - releases in near future so you can listen to it instead of me trying to write something you won' t get anything out of on the releases.
but I said it was three new releases..
that' s right, and the third is finally another one in the bootleg - series, and it was recorded today, and released right after the show.
what' s on it?
Ronny Wærnes & Kjetil Hanssen (yours truely) are the two people playing on this, and it was recorded on Sound Of Mu 10.11. 09 (today), and is titled the same.
it' s limited to 30 copies, and comes in freshly handpainted covers.
everything done right after the Concert.
... by the way... this post was added 3 days late.. 01. Nov. 2009 TWO NEW MP3 - RELEASES: The first of these two are from yet another fine project of the fantastic roar Borge (Cadmium Dunkel), and this is another accoustic band of his called Heppetuna all- Stars.
they' ve released the single från Heppetuna Torg och Inga Fortimärer, which is a strange but good piece of music.
the other release release is also from a Borge - project, which we know already.
Electrique Norwegique of course, and this time it' s their concert from this years "Støy På Landet" - festival.
more music will be released in near future!
24. Okt. 2009 AMBTRASS - 12 READY TO BE DOWNLOADED: The twelfth release in the AMBTRASS - series is out now and is a compilation of live tracks from various origami - projects.
it' s called Live Rough Compilation, and is yet another very fine release!
a pile of new releases are also soon to be released, both as MP3 and CDR.
loads of goodshit to come!
05. Okt. 2009 99 Sanger IS READY TO BE SHIPPED: The disc is finally Ready.
released almost a month ago, but it' s not finally ready to be shipped out to the patient pre - orderers.
it' s a beautiful 99 track disc with Norwegian synth - pop on it' s best. 500 numbered copies only!!!
99 Sanger 21. Sep. 2009 AMBTRASS died IN AUGUST BUT woke UP again IN SEPTEMBER: A slack label- chief seemed to not get the finger out of his anus and upload some Trass- stuff last month, but decided to make things good again by not just uploading one trass, but two trass.
Trass trass!
the first trass which was meant as last months trass was "AMBTRASS - 10 (Origami Replika - SchMerzPønkDaDa - Death To Navy)," and is a very nice trass to be released together with the second trass: "AMBTRASS - 11 (Origami LCA - 2008)," which also is a very fine trass.
for those who don' t know what trass is, read this trass.
not just are we happy to inform you that we finally got these two goodies out, but we still have more to come in the future monts.
and not just that!!!
origami Boe is a little older today, and we say happy birthday here in ambolhute.
this treasure has been lying around since the change between milleniums, and will finally see the day of light.
and guess Who' s lucky enough to release this masterpiece?
yeah, you' re right, it' s Ambolthue Records, and we' re proud of it!
this might be a little on the side of what we usually release here, but it' s just as good as everything else!
maybe even better?
that' s up to you to decide.
anyways, it' s 99 short synth - pop tracks with the memorable poet and underground Musician, and the first time on CD.
the disc has it' s release date today, but it' s still at the pressing plant, so (to use a good old Norwegian expression) "smear some patient on yourself"!
well, this is a notice for all you synth - pop fans out there who loves the sound of the true Norwegian underground - pop from the 80 's / 90' s.
Adrian Cox is back!
with "99 Sanger"!
25. Jul. 2009 6 NEW MP3 releases & THE BOX IS finally READY: OK, where to start?
it' s no less than 6 new MP3 - releases out now, and let' s start on the only one that' s not on the Howbolthue hybrid- label with Howrecording in Poland.
I' m really happy to tell you that the TRASS! - Anarchive - series is back with more origami treasures for you.
one new release every month, and it' s about time to start this again as it' s been almost a year since the last.
the newest addition to the series is "origami Anarchic - Hohlgroth," and it' s a worthy re - start on the series.
you can also buy the full quality copies from here.
the 5 other releases are all in various Howbolthue - series'.
two new Demo' s (KIFBOLD) from Trans Atlantic Rage and origami hairy.
there' s also a new series with re - releases called the Xerox- series (KIFBOLX), and the first out there is the legendary Trepanation - collaboration between Animal Machine (PL), Napalmed (CZ) & Siratori Commitments (JP) that was originally released by Howrecording in only 10 copies back in 2007.
the two last releases are both in the Remix- series (KIFBOLT), and comes both from Animal Machine and are remixes of the classics "Ten Second Compilation II" & "Ten Second Compilation III."
download and listen when you have some time on your hand.
this is released as a kind of promo for their gig at Norwegian noise festival Støy På Landet (translated "Noise in the countryside").
the album is called Støy I Byen (translated "Noise in the city"), and it all spans over 50 minutes.
if you enjoy synthesizers from the 80 's or just generally synth - noise, then this is for you!
back to the summer vacation for Ambolthue then..
need to power up those batteries, and then we will be back with a bunch of new stuff over the summer. 01. may. 2009 2 NEW RELEASES: It' s time for more fresh music on CDR' s on Ambolthue today.
two great releases sounding quite different, but both has got some high quality music on them.
the first is Build A Fort, Set It On Fire - Action Songs For Children which is electro - acoustic experimental music on it' s best.
almost touching into the field of musique concrete without me trying to hard to put it into a specific genre.
you should take a listen for yourself and then decide what to call it.
I just call it a very beautiful release.
the second release today comes from Frenchman, Olivier DuMont: allein Luddite - Musique Pour personne.
this release could probably best be compared with Jon Wesseltoft' s under A Tropical Moon from the previous Ambolthue - catalogue, and as with the Wesseltoft - release, this is Guitar- based noise.
almost droney harsh noise SPRED over 4 tracks, lasting about 50 minutes, this is just a solid noise release, and Ambolthue is proud to present this new commitmenter which we know we will hear more from in the future.
a highly recommended album (as well as the rest of our catalogue).
we also moved MP3AMBOLT - 16 to the Howbolthue catalogue as it' s more suitable for the Howbolt - remix series. 28. Apr. 2009 NEW KIFBOLT: Wabba woy!
yeah, it' s a new howbolts out today, and in the same old fashioned Howbolthue remix- style we love.
this is KIFBOLT - 3: Europe Tour 2008 Collage which is a cut- up mix done by myself (Kjetil Hanssen) with recordings I did on the Europe Tour with Animal Machine, Audun Eriksen, Swamps Up Nostrils & Torstein Wjiik in November / December 2008.
as always co - released with Howrecording.
enjoy!
there' s also been a good update in the mailorder as well.
Lot' s of new stuff. 03. mar. 2009 3 NEW RELEASES: Well it' s been two days since they were released, but as usual I' m a little slow on updating this site.
anyways.
first of all it' s another Card- release in the regular edition og 20.
It' s from Monolab and it' s called Spaceman Stomp (too Much).
the next is the first release done by myself under my proper name (Kjetil Hanssen).
don' t ask me why I did this as Kjetil Hanssen and not Wjiik, but I felt it was more of a Kjetil Hanssen album in some way.
well anyway, it' s called Lynching, and as you might get from the title, it' s inspired by David Lynch.
the first edition comes in a beautiful jakebox - cover with all information hand- written on it.
only 25 copies are available in jakebox.
the last release that came this Sunday (March 1 ST) was the long awaited remix- album of the Maskinanlegg / Solveig Kjelstup - track "Solveigs lied."
the title is not surprisingly Solveigs lied Remixed, and contains the 13 remixes done by a wide range of different artist + the fantastic original to open the record.
this has also been released on 9 other labels with different Artwork on all of them. 22. Feb. 2009 NEW KIFBOLD + A NICE 3 ": KIFBOLD - 1 is finally here.
it' s the Lima - based artist, Apolo who has delivered a nice EP for the next in line Howbolthue - release (the co - release MP3 - series with Howrecording).
this is the first though in the Howbolthue Demo Series, while the standard series keeps on giving you remix- music only.
three nice tracks which is hard to define as something else than experimental.
grab it for free and enjoy!
there' s also a new 3 "out with the new collaboration - project between Torstein Wjiik & Animal Machine called The Wjiik Animal Project.
this release is a live - recording done at "Niu," Barcelona on November last year, and the title is surprisingly Live At Niu.
only 50 copies made of this, so grab it while you can!
and there' s more to come on Ambolthue soon.
we' re working on getting out the rest of the planned stuff!
03. Feb. 2009 NEW FREEBEE (bzzbzz): Another fine and free MP3 - release is now out.
It' s from Cockasians, and the title is Team Of Giraffe Engineers.
a small, nice and sweet one.
get it now!
16. Jan. 2009 NEW Release: Other fine 3 "Criteria is now out on Ambolthue.
it was released Yesterday, and it' s a limited edition of 50 copies 3 "with Jon Wesseltcat called Under A Tropical moon.
there' s two different artworks for this. 4 copies only (was gone on the day of the release) was printed in white cardboard while the rest (46 copies) is printed on black cardboard.
I' ve also added another review into the review - section on this site, but if you don' t understand Norwegian, don' t bother to read it.
but enjoy the many english reviews there as well, for both Torstein Wjiik and Ambolthue. 06. Jan. 2009 NEW year, NEW RELEASES: another year has gone and we' ve entered 2009.
to reflect a little upon what Ambolthue has done in 2008, here are a fewsoft: 48 releases!!!!
damn, that' s a Lot!
and that' s pretty much all there is to say about 2008 without going too much into details.
we' ll calm down a lot in 2009.
to do a fear choise of records to say a few words on from 2008, I' d like to chose the factory - pressed ones.
it' s two of them, so I think that' s fear to the rest.
the first vinyl on Ambolthue, which we co - released with Synesthetic Recordings, came this year.
it was a self - titled debut- release on 7 "by Phonoloid (evil vinyl- recycling), and comes with beautiful Artwork by Bjørn Kjetil Johansen.
the other release was the debut- CD from Bjerga / Iversen which is a compilation of selected works from their over 50 - records long discography up until this point.
never before on CD, just CDR, vinyl, Latvia - cut and tape.
this is a must!
for your own pleasure take a look through the News- site, catalogue, etc. to look back upon all the fine stuff Ambolthue has released this Year!
but now over to the NEW releases today.
there' s two fresh MP3 - releases from some fellow - Norwegian experimentalists.
a single from Fisk På Disc called I Hvalrossens tegn, and a full length album from Swamps Up Nostrils called Veranda Exoappartment.
upgrade your collection and get pleased with fine new experimental "driiit" from Norway!
We' ve finally updated the mailorder again!
16 NEW releases!!!: Yes it' s true.
a whole lot of long awaited releases are finally ready to go.
four Freebies and as much as twelve physical releases are now out.
still busy days here, and it may take a while for me to actually get your copies out when ordering, but please mail me if it' s anything.
"one - man label" + "Too many releases" = "Fun and distraction."
I really mean it when I say all of these are great buys!
Rawman' s debut- LP, two Animal Machine Classics, Concréttes, TLASILA + Lezet, _whALe_pLICATIONE_ & Maranata.
all of these quite different releases, but each is unique.
get them all or find the most Suiting for you!
if everything goes as planned there' ll be some free MP3 - samples so you can take a peak into these soon.
there' ll be some delay on the Mailorder up untill new years.
sorry, but I need to charge my Christmas - batteries.. 27. OCT. 2008 NEW MP3 - ALBUM: we' re celebrating the Norwegian "mørketid" (dark - time) here in Norway after setting the time one hour back.
and Ambolthue want to give a free gift for you.
it' s been a while since we decided to get out a release with darph / nader, but now it' s finally here.
another free release, called Undead Beetle Muzak. 02. OCT. 2008 NEW Artwork ON AMBOLT- 6: The new Artwork for Kamloops - I Got To Hold A Hummingbird Today is Ready.
if you have the old Artwork please send it to me for trade for the new official.
sorry for the trouble.
You' ll get a free of choise CDR from the Ambolthue catalogue (if still available) and paid shipping for the old cover to me if you help us:) 22. Sep. 2008 AMBOLTHUE APOLOGIZES FOR USING Artwork without ARBEMENT!!!!!!
: I want to apologize for using images without confirming with the owner that it was ok to use it for Artwork.
this is also meant to be a wake up call for people out there who may do the same mistake as me and use something for Artwork that they haven' t confirmed is ok to use in forhand.
the Artwork on AMBOLT- 6 used two pictures without it being ok for the owner of the images.
No excuse for that, and I want to warn people out there who maybe run a label or somethingsoftelf that you should be sure that you have the rights to use the Artwork before using it.
I' m really sorry for using images without clarifying it first and for everyone out there with this release or if you know someone who has it, please let me know and I' ll send new Artwork in trade for the old which is not official any more.
I' ll pay the shipping costs for the trade, and give everyone a bonus for their co - operation.
and once again..
I' m really sorry for letting this happen.
it' s not my intention to steal or missuse other people' s private stuff, and I can asure you, this won' t happen again.
cheers everyone, and keep in mind that it' s easy to do mistakes, so be careful and double - check next time.. 20. Sep. 2008 NEW RELEASES: we' re finally ready with some more physical shit, and this time it' s goodshit (as always)!
the debut from origami Metallika is one of these.
it' s almost a year since this was meant to be released but for some reason it never came.
but it' s worth waiting for, cause this is fucking harsh noise on it' s best (at least one of my own projects that I' m most satesfied on the noise - result with).
the Noise Of Rust!
is not a choise, but a must!
another one of those long awaited releases are Catching Flames In And Empty Sky which is not only released on CDR, but on single - sided Tape as well.
It' s Seijiro Murayama, Martin competell & Per Gisle Galåen who has recorded this blast of a release. 100 numbered copies on CDR and 50 numbered on tape..
legendary Astro / Hiroshi Hasegawa has also become a member of the Ambolthue - clan.
with his recording from this year' s Borealis Festival he has come with an album (not surprisingly) called Live At Borealis Festival.
this is another awesome release from an artist many people might know best from C. C. C., but should have known for more than that!
he has been in other bands as well, such as YBO2, Club SDGs & Ginkakuji and been recording solo for 15 years now as well.
there are only 100 copies of this fantastic piece of live - psychedelic - noise, so get it before it' s to late.
and finally, we' re all fans of the Card- releases in 20 copies each, and this time it' s a live recording from this years Nøduttivity Festival with Laup String Quarted who had a strange, funny and entertaining concert at Bremnes Fort where they played Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (By Memory) which is also the title on the card.
only 3 copies left for sale after all the artist copies and such is send away, so be quick if you don' t want to wait for the card- comp. 24. Aug. 2008 MORE FREE MUSIC: The next Ambtrass is uploaded and it' s another fine one from origami agents Anonymous.
album Two is the name and you' ll probably like it!
I do at least!
the other free release is from Aatmaa.
om Namo Veerabhadraya Rudra Bhairavaya Hum Phat Swaha is the name and it' s an album made entierly on a home made instrument.
this is Mellow noise and it' s really enjoyable as well. 14. Aug. 2008 3 NEW RELEASES: First is a free Downloadable co - released compilation remix which I co - released with How recording.
It' s The fastest Compilation Remix In The World, and it' s Remixed by Animal Machine.
we know how little time people got these days, so we made it easy for you!
133 tracks in under 1 second.
enjoy!!
the second release was originally released in 1984 on Trygve Mathiesen' s "Livider" label, and is said to be one of the first (if not the First) noise - release in Norway.
it' s Øyvind Hellner' s Wolf, and Ambolthue Records is proud to get the oppertality to give this release life again on the more modern (but crappier) CDR format.
long live tapes, but hell (NER), the original treasure should be the only one available on tape.
but why not by the Cannes and tape it yourself.
it' s got the original Artwork as well!
and finally, we got the next release in the card- series released.
it' s 6 male wierdo' s who had a small concert at last years Støy På Landet festival, playing all on just balloons.
this is a recording of this, and it' s released on a card called Balloony tunes.
this is strange, yet beautiful. 24. Jul. 2008 ANOTHER NEW AMBTRASS: origami Replika meant to release this as a 10 "- vinyl 10 years ago, but it never happened.
so I' ve got the pleasure to release this.
you can check out info on the MP3 - release titled "Roots 80 Remix" if you like, and download it from the same link.
this is great, and should be released on 10 "still.
who knows.
maybe bootlegged 10 "- vinyls will appear some day?
12. Jul. 2008 NEW AMBTRASS: Finally, the June - release is now out, a little Alte, but it' s still the June - release available from origami Economic from the 24 th of June.
anyway, read more about it here. 10. Jul. 2008 NEW 7 "- Release: Finally, the first vinyl is out on Ambolthue and it' s a co - released 7" with Synesthetic Recordings once again.
this release is the debut vinyl dissection by Norwegian occult noise duo Phonoloid on this imaginatively titled 7, "limited to 204 copies.
I won' t sell this myself through the mailorder, but you can get it from Looop which is my main distro.
this is a fucking awesome release, so get it while you can!!!!
I' ve also posted a new review in the review - section.
I' ll try to post more reviews there soon as well as there are some missing.
I' ve just been too busy lately. 04. Jun. 2008 NEW REMIX- COMP.
out Now: The remix- compilation of DJ Bra Nesegir' s "No sides" anti - record (7 "- vinyl scratched with sand- paper and sprayed with silver spray) is now finally out.
it' s a label- split with Synesthetic Recordings and it' s limited to 40 copies only.
the Artwork is hand made carboard cover with pieces of broken vinyl glued on and sprayed afterwards.
the title of this lovely obscure release is siste sort, and this is probably the best looking record you' ll get this year. 28. may. 2008 NEW AMBTRASS: The new Trass!
Anarchives / AMBTRASS - release is here.
this is the debut from origami Satanika, and it' s called Någonting Är På väg.
this is a dark ambient and a quite droney release, and it' ll play well on your sterio.
download it, get the red paper, print and burn, and enjoy these 22 minutes of fantastic sounds. 26. may. 2008 NEW Release: As Maranata and Lasse Marhaug played a concert together Yesterday at Café Mono in Oslo, Maranata released their new CDR here on Ambolthue called "screaming In Tounges."
as I' m not pressing these copies myself, it' s not a huge stock I' m sitting on.
I have no idea how soon I get to re - press more copies, so if you want a copy, buy it now!
I' ll get more copies soon, but it' s only 50 copies in total, so it won' t last too long. 12. may. 2008 THREE NEW RELEASES: And they' re all physical.
first out is a release that I' ve been planning to get out since I made the track.
it' s a 44 minute long piece and a follow up to the War- album in the Anti - War Series I' ve got as Torstein Wjiik.
this is the second of all together 6 releases that will make up the series.
I hope to collect these albums into a box sometime later on.
this new one is called Hirsoshima and has a lot of the same elements as "War" has.
it' s got a ambient structure, but I' ll promise you some harsh stuff again.
the second release I' ve got out today also includes Torstein Wjiik tracks.
this is a mini - album split with Animal Machine lasting just about 10 minutes.
what s maybe enough?
Strange but nice album this (if it really can be called an album?)!
it' s also released on Howrecording in Poland in even smaller edition than on Ambolthue. 10 to be exact, while Ambolthue released the 1 st edition in 23 copies.
the name of the record is quite long, and it is called "Balance Of Disorder, 3.5 Whereason years Resistance Toaching / Good Day To You Sir.
how' s It Going? "
enjoy!
the final release is number 50 in my catalogue.
I know I' ve got some gaps, but believe me..
some day it ll be out.
this record is a 3 - way split between Kobi, Crazy River & Love Hz and it' s called "Live In Kobe.
this release was recorded during these three artists tour of Japan during March 2007.
all these tracks was recorded at the hogeva Lounge, Kobe, Japan 26. mar. 2007.
if you' re looking for one of the best live splits this year I guess this should be ample the records you can choose between. 26. Apr. 2008 TWO NEW RELEASES: Other Trass- release is out now.
it' s from origami Uniomystika this time and it' s called Jesus Loves You.
download it now!!!
another new release is also available.
the Norwegian Noise Orchestra concert from the Øya Festival in 2007 in the Dans For Voksne TENT is now available on CDR from Ambolthue in limited edition of 40 copies sprayed disc version.
the title is of course as easy as Live At Øyaf Rusen with beautiful photos on the cover taken by Tore Borvik.
there' s also a un- sprayed version available that I' ll start to sell when the sprayed ones are sold out, and that the artists may sell if the want.
that edition is Unlimited. 32 minutes of noises from 17 different persons.
Sounds like a blast?

14. mar. 2008 orders IN SPAM - Box: I just want to warn everyone who' s sending me mails with orders that I have a strict spam - filter and I get over 100 spam - mails a day, but when I pressed the delete all spam - button Yesterday I noticed (while the mail was updating) that I had an order- mail in the spam - box.
this may have happened before as well, so if you haven' t had any response on orders it' s because it has gone in the spam - box.
I' ll try to check trough the spam - box better in the future, but use topics like "ORDER" or "DEMO" etc if you' re mailing me.
it' s easier to discover the mails in the spam - pile then.
sorry if you' re one of the unlucky ones. 08. mar. 2008 FREE VIDEO - Release: I just released a Downloadable version of "Enviromental Testing Device - Insects v.
machines, "also released as VCD on How recording.
It' s a 1 minute long video in WMV (please ask me for other formats if you can' t play wmv / windows media video) and it can be downloaded from here: Insects v.

Liturgy
these are the weekly Liturgy reflections by Moviment Kersoftgma
the meeting started at the request of the Movement.
the ecumenism in Church Life is the relationship between the Catholic Church and other churches.
it is an important part of the Church' s mission to deliver the Word of Jesus with words and crops.
the ecumenism is that the Church puts in practice what Jesus said: "I ask that all be one thing."
Jesus set up a single church, but throughout the centuries range raised large and serious flocks.
the ecumenism word means everything relating to a relationship between Christians of different churches, but not other religions, such as Mussulmani, Buddist, etc.
Christians are all members of the same Christian religion - they are all overwhelming on behalf of the Trinity, have the same Bible, believe in Jesus Christ, celebrate the same great fests.
these are Catholics, Orthodosi Christians and Protestating Christians.
Jesus set up a single Church, but during the time some flocks took place.
in the year 1054 it was held that between the Church of Rome and the Orthodox, when the Pope communicated to the Coastantinoples Party on some beliefs and learning.

the popular image sharing site protects over 1 billion users, with more than 1 million active users per day.
everyone and everyone are on Instagram, and with all those people there share and comment on the places and pictures, you think that the achievement of followers is a cake piece.
but, like most things in life, building a well- established social media presence takes a licence and determination.
even experts say it is hard work.
according to the Social Media Enlargement specialist, Talia Koren, building a strong follow - up on any social media platform is a huge commitment, and the achievement of those who love and precious followers takes a strategy, ability, and much time.
Mr Insta is your Free Solution

so he - free!

read more
it is really simple and takes a few minutes only from your time.
simply login, activated the free plan and will be presented with Instagram profiles to follow it.
these Instagram profiles will be aimed at your interests and may exceed any not to follow.
after having followed the number of profiles required, your plan will be activated.
we deliver followers Instagram to your account within 48 hours, without questions.
better than all, you can repeat this step every 48 hours.
this means that you can continue to grow your account forever!
we even have options for our customers additionally follow Instagram for free.
if your account needs the commitment, you can buy an Instagram follow - up, love, comments, and more.
or, join one of our monthly subscription plans.
these plans lead relevant followers or love a place to your profile every day; all this in exchange for a low monthly tariff.
do you ask whether the purchase or aid free of charge is good for you?
if so, read about the best 7 reasons why to get more followers is the best move to your business and brand.
you want to build legitimacy for your company
with the growing importance of social media for businesses, account performance has become a factor to decide whether customers want to do business with you.
if your business profile has a large number of followers, you will appear to customers that your company has been around time and know what you are doing.
companies with little followers and low commitment appear without experience.
as a result, customers can decide to buy your product.
you have additional followers make your profile more professional and lead the chance to catch real customers.
you' re new in social media and your profile can use lift
it is the narrow truth that most of the new profiles of Instagram find it difficult to note before they are able to achieve significant follow - up.
in some professions, such as the fashion industry, models are neither considered for rental if they do not have a certain number of followers.
the reason is, many firms must employ people who are well known in their field for that type of work.
this can put advanced models at an extreme disadvantage when trying to dry.
while we hope that your industry is not so strict, the fact of the issue is new business accounts, and association, new businesses, have great difficulty in appearing.
it' s a little known trick, but many companies have already bought an Instagram followers.
so he, restaurants, athletes, clothing marks, and even all politicians bought followers for their accounts and saw best results.
by spending a small portion of your marketing budget on the Instagram followers, you almost do the same thing to pay to promote a place on Instagram.
the difference is that your money goes far more away when buying followers because you are sure to receive the amount you buy.
when strengthening a post, the best to do is the hope of reaching a few hundred followers, and the results are not guaranteed.
you must be considered by a larger customer audience
think in the way you can judge the friend' s profile that does not have many followers, or a place that does not have a lot of commitment.
it can be difficult to admit, but ultimately, we all think the same thing when we see these posts; this person is not popular.
this thought comes from a characteristic of human behaviour called "social proof." according to social evidence, we tend to judge how to bring themselves and what they love on the basis of how they are bringing themselves and love.
you can see this in action on each social media platform.
it' s a way to get viral.
someone sees an interesting place, to share it with their followers.
their followers see that the person must have enjoyed the place because they shared it, and therefore their followers also start sharing it.
Instagram favours posts from accounts that have a high commitment and have a large number of followers.
as your places get a traction with love and comments, if your account has many followers, you will appear higher and higher in searches.
quickly the leverage starts a ice ball, and before a long time, large amounts of people saw your office.
when buying Instagram followers, you are taking the first step towards going viral, and you have to appear from thousands, or even millions of customers.
it has been too committed to other business initiatives
business management takes many hard work and energy.
there is a need to complete a number of tasks to make operations smoothly, but there are only so many hours on the day.
we already spoke about the amount of time it takes to build a strong Instagram coming, and chances are, you have a full list of washing other business tasks, perhaps more important, that is necessary to complete.
you can rent a social media manager to take care of your profile, but this would mean a cover over $50,000 per year for their salary and benefits.
if you buy Instagram followers, save yourself money and resources you take to rent someone or grow your own account.
this freezes precious time on your day, which allows you to focus better on important objectives of the company.
you want to build the following on other social media sites
Facebook bought Instagram back in 2012.
when both companies join, platforms made it possible to put Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr right from your Instagram!
you can even change your settings to send automatically on Facebook every time to put on Instagram.
because both work closely Facebook and Instagram, chances are if you are popular on Instagram, it will not be long before you have popularity on Facebook well.
buying Instagram followers strengthens your popularity and gives you a better chance to become popular also on other sites.
you need some positive reviews
analysis sites such as Yelp, Google Business and Trip Advisor are no longer the only place where customers can leave their views.
an Instagram account with many followers is similar as the business Yelp profile with many positive reviews.
after all, people who follow your page have signed to see your content, and therefore your products, in their news every day.
odds are, think quite very much of your business!
when potential customers see a large number of followers and a high commitment on your locations, the effect is the same to see many positive reviews.
the achievement of followers makes your products and services a high quality for consumers and serves as a means to improve your classification among your competition.
want to do more money!
social media has become a very important part of any marketing strategy.
the reason you' ve worked time to create profiles on various platforms is simple, that you want to increase profits for your business.
everyone from Instagram billion users is a potential customer.
but, due to Instagram' s algorithm, it can be very difficult to see it even a fraction of those customers.
the purchase of Instagram followers increases instantly the number of people watching your products.
more people see your products, the more likely people buy your products, increase your sales, and help your company' s bottom line.
do you still ask whether buying or service free of charge is good for you?
every day more businesses join Instagram as a way to promote their products to their customers.
this means, competition is growing only, and the most difficult is to ensure that your company' s voice is heard. "
when making the option to buy Instagram followers, you immediately boost your business market efforts and establish a presence for your mark.
save time on your working day, get popularity with your audience, and ultimately, earn more money for your business.
buying followers is one of the best marketing secrets held and is a useful and effective way to known your business on social media.

they can see your personal messages, find information about your friends and potentially send spam or other harmful content on your profile.
this puts your safety, and the safety of your friends at risk.

during the years, we never had an Instagram prohibited.
we continuously review the updates made by Instagram and adjust our delivery methods accordingly.
these Instagram followers are real?
we actually provide real fans to our paid customers, unlike 98% of websites there.
many other websites declare that they offer this service for free, but do not do this!

our service is a community that allows people with their mind to find each other and combine.
we just the mediator.
you should not be crushed by sites that say they provide real followers.
it has always been said that if it appears too good to be true, it is likely to be.. and to be completely transparent, we must note that the quality of the followers will vary.
this is why some people simply put much more effort in their accounts by others.
this is the same to say about Instagram as a whole.

studies show that if your page does not have much content or if you are providing new content and leverage on a regular basis your numbers will fall.
we do our best to provide people of similar interests.
this means that if you assume that your page is providing content about the interests you have chosen before activating a free or paid plan you are likely to keep and grow your page.
experts suggest that the stationing of quality content 1 - 3 times a day appears to attract the best results.
it is important to take your time with your places.
ensure that photos / videos are of high quality and relate to your Instagram theme.
Finally, make sure you interact with your audience.
if you comment on your posts be sure to answer them.
also consider visiting their page and giving them like or two.
it will move forward when we come to create long - term relationships with your page.

once you have successfully activated the plan for free, you typically start seeing new people start following your profile within 5 minutes.

we are a group of people who love to come out with great tools that everyone can use, irrespective of who you or where you are in the world.
there is no other site of social media growth that can really say it.
since the beginning in 2013, when we began not yet a long time before all other sites began to duplicate our services.
however, they did not fall in many ways.

the first reason to get subscribers for free is quite simple - you want to build a more substantial channel after!
whether you are a new user, or maybe you already have YouTube canal but you have problems to get traction, some additional subscribers can go far to develop a strong and strong commitment.
YouTube algorithm favours multi - subscribers channels showing their content to a wider audience.
this creates an effect of ice ball because more people see your canal, the more likely to subscribe to it also.
you want to get us on other social media sites
most social media sites there can be binding together for each user.
this makes it easy to share content between platforms, and exponentially increase your audience size.
if a video is popular on YouTube, there is an extreme chance that subscribers send video in their social accounts.
more YouTube subscribers mean more people potentially can help disseminate your videos on other platforms.
soon, the movie appears everywhere, and you even stay the chance to go viral.
go viral
it is the dream of every YouTuber.
go viral, bring your content considered by millions, and go to the history of YouTube with our iconic videos such as "Charlie Bit My Finger" and "Harlem shake." can appear only as "15 minutes of reputation," but in reality, many consumers see products and take purchasing decisions after they have been aware of them on social media.
sometimes it is mystery because certain things become viral, but generally, high - quality videos with qattiel content tend to be noted.
however, it is how much to compile your videos artificially, if you do not have a number of decent subscribers, it is doubtful that someone sees your videos.
you have more follow - up means that your YouTube channel appears in more "suggested content" of YouTuber.
that snowball effect leaves, and before you know this, your brand videos are divided worldwide from millions of people.
you have free YouTube subscribers is just the first step.
recover from a few non- popular videos
social media is great because it gives voice to almost everyone on the planet.
everyone can share his opinion with a button cap.
but well, it also goes wrong, and users have even greater ability to wip the wrongly across the world as their audience.
if you have found some negative comments that promise your video ratings, increasing your subscribers' number will help to combat this.
it is called social proof, and is how humans learn what they should do and what they should do.
people are more inclinked to love something you think other people like it also.
the opposite is also true; a person judge something as bad or not popular if you see other people do not also agree to it.
YouTube subscribers are like votes in favour, think of as positive reviews.
even if your canal has a few non- popular videos but has a high number of subscribers, other users will assume that your mark is popular, and there is more chance to pour a few dislikes here and there.
increase the legitimacy of your mark
YouTube channels with just subscribers seem to be flameful.
new businesses still attract customers because everyone must be the first to find the new place "IT."
but, after the powder stand if you have not built a list of large subscribers, people will think there is something bad in your brand.
if you have a YouTube followers for free, your mark appears to be considered long enough to make a decent name for itself.
this build trust with your customers and increases your chances to sell more products for your business.
your following YouTube needs to be fostered
just like every relationship, building a strong social media after it is a great commitment.
businesses will normally have members of staff dedicated to managing their social media accounts.
but these people do not work for free.
businesses spend thousands of dollars to cover annual salaries and benefits, and new companies with a narrow margin often cannot be achieved.
maintaining a substantial presence on social media is full- time work because it is not enough to passive videos on YouTube if you want to notify.
you need time and energy to put, share, and comment actively, such as, see, and enter your audience, almost as if your business was a real person.
but it is that personal connection to make YouTube such a tool!
there is no doubt that your business needs to be on YouTube; it is only a matter of how you will take care of responsibility.
you can take the massive project yourself, but you also have many other business needs that request your attention.
youTube subscribers for free carry the burden of building your YouTube presence from the beginning of your shelter.
you can rely easy by knowing that your followers are taken care and re - focus on critical commercial initiatives.
it appears higher in searches
we have already spoke about how YouTube algorithm favours multi - subscribers channels by exposing it to a wider audience.
part of this relates to where these channels classify in searches.
it is like this, let' s say that you themselves restorant that is known for cooking freshest grass.
if your business YouTube canal has less subscribers from the oil spoon in the block, their videos appear higher in searches from your ones, even if your winter insalate can convert the nearest carnivores.
so, you don' t matter how well your content, with a low number of subscribers risk losing a business for a lesser mark.
I have worked very for your business, and you want to make sure you are forgotten.
the achievement of YouTube subscribers helps you ensure that your mark appears at the top of the list in searches, and that your content exceeds competition.
it is a popular trick used by thousands of accounts
YouTube is a valuable tool for negotiators.
taking canal subscribers is like you have people to sign to look at your products every day.
not only YouTube is an essential part of any marketing strategy but you have YouTube subscribers for free is one of the best secrets held in the industry.
be surprised by the number of accounts there with non- organic subscribers and followers.
models, drivers of the exhibition, even political, all obtained YouTube subscribers for their accounts and are seeing the popularity of their channels increases right to their eyes.
most of us have obtained Ad credit for free from Facebook.
it is the same thing.
think to get followers like to boost a place on Facebook, both that are viable methods to increase your subscribers.
the only difference is, to increase posts on Facebook and other sites is a risk because you are not guaranteed a certain number of followers or even regular commitments.
increase business revenue
like every business, you must add your South line.
YouTube is the perfect platform to convert potential purchasers in customers for their lives by sharing committed videos on your brand.
all this leads to this.
free YouTube subscribers, you can build more substantial following for your business.
from there, your videos can spread to other sites such as Facebook, and you have the chance to go viral; and expose your mark to millions of consumers.
we also look at other benefits, but what fails for each reason is that the increase in the number of YouTube subscribers will lead to greater business revenue.
Hello.. for free!
chances are the title of this article raises your interest.
subscribers YouTube for free are found rare, but there are companies there who are leaving subscribers!
they are not only bot to admit your account; they are real users that help to increase organically the number of your subscribers and for your business there.
so what does this mean for your business?
what Susansoftcicki says is undoubtedly true; YouTube has something for all.
as a business on YouTube, however, it is not enough to be something for it, you should strive to be something for everyone.
because you can sound, YouTube became more popular than network television, and even with cable.
users feel a unique connection with the platform and channels that follow due to the close look they give them in the daily lives of the marks.
you have free YouTube subscribers is the best way to start your YouTube presence and open the door to business success.

the Glass film, follows two films that Director Shyamalan successfully produced.
in 2000 he issued the first film entitled: Unbreakable and 2016, Shyamalan released for a second film display: split.
these three films form an easy trilogy 177.
at the beginning of the film we stay with David Dunn who is working with his son Joseph to use the sovruman forces that had to protect people from criminal.
he knows from his son that Kevin Wendell Crumb, who suffer from dissociation Identity Disorder (DID) was holding four girls in a store.
Kevin Wendell Crumb, a super Roman who had benefited "The Beast," had created a great fear in the areas when he began to seize girls many of whom were never found.
the body' s chemical of Kevin was replaced by any personality showing, as a result that the twenty - four personality he possessed, were all collected in one known as "The Beast."
David decides to go and release these girls.
when he managed to release girls, David meets Kevin with the personality of "The Beast."
there is a struggle between them that ended on the roads.
the police is called and David and Kevin, end up arrested and taken at the mental institute where there was a gaven for Elijah Price treatment which in the past had to deal with David.
Dr Ellie staple, the main bomb in this Institute, was working with patients claiming that they possess special strengths.
to help them suppress these thoughts, provided they persuade them that it was not true what they thought and that there was no human beings who possess these strong sovrumani.
Dr staple believed that they were mentally sick.
meanwhile, Elijah was working with Kevin to release "The Beast" and exposes it to the world that true supereroies exist.
with the help of "The Beast," Elijah also manages to escape but David is won with what happened and exit to follow them.
there is a skill fight between David and Kevin in the main entrance outside the Institute.
Dr staple wins what was happening and prepared it for the assistance of armed people and who were part of a secret society against sovrums.
what happens here?
American film, exciting play, is under the direction and writing of M.
Night Shyamalan.
because of so many blood violence as well as goff and profan words, it would be good that the film will see it big only.
σwtήp
"in Easter, man obtains the lost dignity and is consequently" given hope. "
this is Saviation. "
σwtήp, sotaltēr, salvator ,ellies
in the language of Jesus, the Jewish, to say salvation, tells him (such as Jesus' name, Jexûà).
now with the Jewish, the word would give rise to it has the consonates of root J X, 'the same root of the Maltese word "width (Għ)."
the Greek translates this word with σwtnpίa, sotaltēría.
a good image for this idea is the silk dude that becomes pupa (chrysalis) and is released for width in a beautiful, all wings, which can free butter and even give life because it helps to conceive flowers and fruit with its polinisation.
Christ Jesus is my savior and yours, the σwtήp, snowtēr, the Savior or better heels, because we get us from what we keeps us in ourselves because of his sin and consequences and come us to the width of God' s children.
"today in the City of David twild you Savior, who is Christ, Lord" (Lk 2, 11); "You mention Jesus, because he will release his people from their sins" (Mt 1, 21).
how many miracles did Jesus relate to the spiritual reality of man only?
the biggest number of miracles have been done in relation to the body.
rather, in the miracle of the paralytic that we get him from the roof: "'Mela to know that Son of man has the power to flee sins on the ground," said to the agreement,' Qum, I say to you, bridge yours and go to your home. "(Mk 2, 10 - 12) The physical healing has now become a spiritual healing signal.
physical and spiritual healing together became the sign of full salvation.
the Son became a man and died on the cross for me and for you, with his resurrection to give us the possibility to rebuild in full human beings.
in his resurrection we will give God that looks at us and see a fine what is very good.

Simon Busuttil confirms that it does everything for votes
today Simon Busuttil made a whole Belgium to hunters and shield as much as it is in favour of the hunting.
Ralph Cassar, Secretary - General of AD and candidate on districts 7 and 11 said: "The majority of Simon Busuttil today in Siġġiewi to hunters and for hunting shows his hypocrearship.
on the one hand, it comes to the environmentists and says both its parties is a 'environmentist' and from the other happens after the hunters for votes.
this is another example of how much PN goes, such as PL, for arrogating and healthy lobbies. "
"the PN, such as PL does not interfere with a harsh and free campaign for the enjoyment of people, children and families but must continue to leave it to the few fares."
"there is no choice between PL and PN.
alternative vote is the true clean vote.
hunting control also depends on the will of the government.
Simon Busuttil, such as Joseph Muscat is not interested in making serious checks. "
"with a depositary Referendum, that we are AD reproduce, can citizens propose which laws release them, with limited exceptions such as taxation and security laws - Simon Busuttil intend to decide and only what can the citizens of this country propose?
citizens in a democratic country, with a serious law on the referenda, not subject to the will of either Busuttil or Muscat. "

do you ever think about how can I affect your employment or life?
do you want to learn more about what is really the AI - and how to create?
do you want to understand how the AI will develop and affect customs in the coming years?
our goal is to celebrate the AI
the AI elements are a series of free online courses created by Reaktor and the University of Helsinki.
we want to encourage a group as great as possible to learn what AI is, what can (and what cannot) be done with AI, and how to create AI methods.
the courses combine theory with practical exercises and can be completed with your step.
- Artificial Intelligence refers to theory and development of computerised systems capable of doing things which normally requires human intelligence.
- for businesses, Artificial Intelligence means a completely new era regarding research.
companies who are willing to learn by experimenting are those who are making the most progress; and are likely to be those who are gaining advantage.
- The idea has a simple, Nordic ring to it: Start by teaching 1% of the country' s population, or about 55,000 people, the basic concepts at the root of artificial technology, and gradually build on the number over the next few years.
- AI is going to have as big an impact on our society as electricity.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of board, Nokia
- For AI to be successful, not only do we have to develop it; we also must work on finding diverse ways of utilizing AI.
and it' s not just up to the engineers, which is why it' s so great that the Elements of AI course is free for anyone to attend.
Elina Lepomäki, Member of Parliament

who we
"we live in a science to Jesus Christ and faithfully read him with a yellow heart and with good conscience," (Regula, 2); this phrase taken by the writings of S.
Paul is the basis of all that contains our karma and the foundation on which Albertu [Jerusalem] built our life programme.
the Carmeliteans live the obedience to Christ by seeking without stopping God' s face in fraternity and in the performance among the people.
the contemplation starts when we were left to God, whatever the way it chooses to move to us.
it is a behaviour whereby we have opened for God, which we find it present everywhere.
so the contemplation is made for the Carmelitan interior path coming from God' s free will to drive and lead him to the full unity of love with him, giving him the grace to enjoy the fact that he is loved by God and lives in all his love.
this is a experience of God' s love to change us.
this love has suffered us from human, limited and imperfect ways of thinking, love, and bring our soul, and changes them into divine ways.

No breast enlargement?
for many breast- size women is a large factor of how to measure their physical appearance and can have a great effect on self - confidence.
find a solution!
clinical studies confirm this:
you can add female breast size!
you can get a bigger perky breast!
you can improve your appearance!
do you suffer from small female breasts?
while everyone' s ideal is different, many societies prefer a woman with a bigger perky breast.
when a woman finds itself missing in that area you can download its own confidence and make her feel less female.
breast enlargement
what is breast enlargement?
female breast growth starts at puberty.
budding, the initial eruption of small head under theola is often one of the first signs of puberty and generally occurs around the age of 10 to 12 years.
however, girls can start experiencing breast growth up to 7 years, and some other girls may not experience breast growth before 12 years or later.
the onset of puberty and the development of the wrapped chest is affected by a number of factors.
while breast size is partly hereditary; global health, weight, physical activity, nutrition and even stress levels can and have an effect on breast size.
for some girls, breast growth is slow and for others can appear like their breasts seen during night.
while all girls are different, generally takes 3 to 5 years for breast to develop completely.
female breast is primarily composed of fatty tissue and mmarmed glands located on the pectoral muscle.
the mammare glands are milk- producing glands used during breast- feeding.
theola is the darkest area of the chest that turns the nipple.
as the breast grows, theola is also not.
while many know that hormone oestrogen plays a big roll in the growth of other hormones also have an effect.
steroids Progesterone works with oestrogen during puberty to develop mmare glands in women.
all women also have testosterone in their system, only at lower levels than men.
if your testosterone level is too high this can negatively affect breast size.
the prolactin hormone controls the level of fat storage in female breast.
during pregnancy it is prolactin to contribute to an increase in breast size.
all these hormones work in concert both during puberty and during life to effect breast size.
for most women breasts wrapped to grow a few years after the beginning of puberty.
for women with small breasts this can be disheartening.
however, once puberty is on it is possible to start breast enlargement and increase female breast size.
female breast size
many women struggle with proper and precisely determine their breast size.

questions ON THE ILMA
the scarcity of the water resource in Malta has always been a reality.
in fact, this was highlighted in the first report on the water resource in the Maltese Islands which goes back to half of the year 1500.
Malta, with a semiarida climate, with long dry summer and winter without much rainfall contributes to a lymph availability of renewable natural water.
the situation continues to complicate itself with the high density in the population of the islands that generate a great demand for water, which continues to increase the scarcity of this resource.
a few figures: The United Nations considers 500 m3 per person per year of renewable water naturally, as the minimum water limit.
the current level in the Maltese Islands is estimated at 100 m3 per person every year, placing Malta among the first ten countries with water scarcity.
although in the Maltese islands there are no large and permanent rivers systems, they are various ears, flourish and water- finding still in the year.
the presence of water in these small places and bones are of important support for the endemic ecosystem.
the main fresh water resource in the Maltese Islands is the water of the plan that exists in two types: that stagnated and at sea level.
the availability of the plan' s water has always been historically supporting the development of our country' s economy and remains up to today' s day an important resource in water supply.
Yes, groundwater is called groundwater.
the water of the plan forms when water enters the surface of the ground and fill the gap between the rock (pores and / or sharing).
the geology of Malta gives rise to two types of groundwater - primarily the water of the plan found between the top stones and clay, and the water of the plan at sea where fresh water keeps on sea water at the neck level.
both types of groundwater are very vulnerable to surface pollution, while groundwater water at sea level is vulnerable to marine water revenue in response to extraction activities.
the waterproof Affairs of the plan in Malta are various, but all are made of human activity such as agriculture, industry and other daily activities.
one of the most polluting things of the plan' s water is nitrate which primarily originates from extra fertilisation in agriculture.
another contribution is from the leakages from sewage which may also result from the introduction of things which are derived from our homes in the plan' s water system.
including personal care products, medicines and other chemical products we use every day.
fortunately no such traces have yet been found in water of the Malta plan.
the fresh water supply of Malta comes from the following four resources: (i) groundwater, (ii) desalination water, (iii) rain water and (iv) water.
these water resources are used to meet the needs of water users depending on their needs.
the water of the plan and water of the seawater are therefore used for the production of drinking water while drinking water, polluting water and rainfall water are used for other purposes including agriculture and industry.
in total, the Maltese Islands consume about 60 million cubic metres of water per year, around nofsu is used for beverages.
due to the lack of natural fresh water resources available, drinking water in Malta is a desalination water mix by the reverse osmosis and groundwater plants.
an increase in population and living level is leading to an increase in national water demand.
fresh water is mainly used in Maltese homes, where a mix of drinking water is used, recycled water and stored rainfall water.
many think the washing machine is the most water- use household appliances.
the reality is that the most used water at home is in the bathroom.
toilet money and showers are almost 70% of your daily water consumption.
therefore, they are the best opportunity for everyone to be found less water and to make everyone more efficient in the way water uses.
keep your eyes open to the conservation of water being distributed as part of the campaign, and for the various skills on how to prevent water.
let' s let together, be the change.

the great risk of today' s world, with its abundant and misleading offer of consumption, it is to bear an individual descendist that leaks from the comfortable heart and shrink, from the marriage to superficial places, from isolated conscience.
when the interior life is closed in its interests, there is no longer a width for others, there is no place where the poor comes, the voice of God does not hear more, it does not enjoy more than the sweet joy of love, her heart will no longer be announced with the encouraged to do the wealth.
this risk, sure and lasting, there is even for believers.
many fall into and change in people filled with anger in them, narrow, life - free.
this is not the choice of an appropriate and full life, this is not God' s desire for us, this is not life in the Spirit that leaks from the heart of Christ Rxoxt.
I invite every Christian, which are the place and the situation in which, to renew today its personal meeting with Jesus Christ or, at least, to take a decision to leave him to meet him, to seek every day without every day.
there is no reason why one should think that this invitation is not for him, because "no one is excluded from the joy that brings the Lord." [1] Who is willing to risk, the Lord does not disappoint him, and when someone makes a little step towards Jesus, discover that He has already been waiting for him with open arms. "
this is the moment for Jesus Christ to say to him: "Lord, deceased, in an elephably hired by your love, but here I am again to renew my pact with you.
I need you.
redeemed, Lord, keep me again in your forgotten arms. "
how much do we do wealth to return to us when we have lost!
once again I forget: God does not defeat; we promise to pray him to shelter for us.
what we have invited us to be afraid "up to seven times" (Mt 18: 22) gives us is the example: He flee for seven and forty times.
return to take us on a spallejh once again.
No one can remove the dignity that we bind us this love without end and that you don' t lose.
he allows us to raise our head up and rebuild, with a sweetness not to mislead ever and that you can always give us again joy.
let' s not shoot from Jesus' resurrection, and, what happens, we never give our soul with a smell.
there is nothing better than his life to drive us to move forward!
in the Testing books the oldest had already proposed the joy of salvation, which had toktor with great in the messenic times.
the Prophet Isaija visits on the Messiah is expected and all of us teach him: "You cattart the gens, chart the hena" (9: 2).
and urges those living in Sijon to welcome him with richness: "We are hurd and joy goal!" (12: 6).
the prophet invited others to announce the others: "It is up on the high mountain, you will get the right bara to Sijon; holy your voice in full, you will give the good news to Jerusalem" (40: 9).
all creation takes part in this salvation joy: "Hannu, heaven, joy joy, o land, greet in the rich, mountains!
for the sake of the Lord to his people; and shelter for his saints! "(49: 13).
when Zacarija moved the day of the Lord, he invited the people to get joy to the following King humble and redeemed onmar: "I congratulate both a girl, Sijon daughter; joy, Jerusalem daughter!
see, your king comes to you; fair and winner "(Zak 9: 9).
but perhaps the most pressing invitation is that of the Sofonia prophet, which shows us to God itself as the whole heart of a feast and joy that wants to lead his people this flame' s eyes.
this silk is a life - driven team when I read it: "The Lord, your God, is in the middle of you, a wars who saves; because you wait with great henaen, in love you will be forgotten because of you in the eyes of joy" (Sof 3: 17).
it is the joy that we find it heart to the small things of everyday life, in response to all the love of the Father: "My Son, get yourself well with yourself, depending on how many you may..
do not deprive of a good day "(Sir 14: 11,14).
some Father' s sweetness is hidden after this words!
the Gospel, in which the Cross of Christ is glory, inviting us strongly for joy.
we are enough to mention some examples: "It is the hope of the angel to Mary (Lk 1: 28).
Mary' s visit to Elizabeth leads John to exceed joy in his mother' s womb (see Lk 1: 41).
in her Lady Mary proclaims: "My spirit congratulates in God, my Savior" (Lk 1: 47).
when Jesus begins his ministry, John will know in the eyes of joy: "This is the joy by which my heart was dead" (Jn 3: 29).
Jesus himself "was raised by joy by the Holy Spirit" (Lk 10: 21).
his message is a source of joy: "I tell you this so that my joy is in you, and for your joy to be full" (Jn 15: 11).
our Christian joy leaks like a water that takes a swing from the eye of his heart.
he promises his disciples: "We are still getting nicket, but your nets are still changing into a hena" (Jn 16: 20).
and stresses: "I can see you and hear you congratulates, and your joy no one will take you" (Jn 16: 22).
later, when he saw him raised by death, they "joy" (Jn 20: 2).
the Apostle Acts Book tells how in the first community they were "joining food with warm hearts" (2: 46).
from each where the disciples had passed "there was great joy" (8: 8), and they are, heart to persecution, "filled with joy" (13: 52).
one ewn, after he baptized, "he went on all his way" (8: 39), and the guardians of prison "joy all the people of his house for believing in God" (16: 34).
why do we also enter this river of joy?
there are Christians that like them live Randan without Easter.
I understand that joy is not everyone live in the same way at all stages and circumstances of life, sometimes hard not just.
it adapts itself and changed, but always remains at least as a descend of light coming from personal certainty that, above all, we are loved with unexpected love.
I understand those people who have moved to the sadness because of the great difficulties they have to suffer, but I read there is a need to leave him to the joy of faith, such as a hidden but full hope, even heart the widest dispersion: "I have been killed by peace, the good was his hands..
this is my heart, so I hope.
the mercy of the Lord without end; he will never be reduced.
renewable every morning, great your fidelity..
it is good to wait in the skins, the salvation of the Lord "(Lam 3: 17,21 - Zen26).
the temptation is often subject to the form of excuse and tgemgim, as if a large number of conditions were needed to make joy possible.
this is because "technological society was capable of fostering the pleasure occasions, but it has repeatedly succeeded in achieving joy." [2] I say that the most beautiful and spontaneous joy that I got with him in my life was that of very poor people who have little to do on their own. "
I also remember in the genuine joy of those who, even among major professional commitments, have the ability to maintain life in them a heart that believes, generous and simple.
in many ways, these forms of joy are brought from the eye of God' s growing love that appeared in Jesus Christ.
we never promised words Benedict XVI who take us at the heart of the Gospel: "As the beginning of the Christian existence there is no ethical decision or a high idea, but there is a meeting with a crafts, with a person, giving the new horizon and decisive direction." [3]
it is only thanks to this meeting - or a re - meeting - with this love of God, which is converted into friendship, that we can be released from our isolated conscience and self - confidentiality.
we come to our human media when we are more than humans, when we leave God out of us ourselves to come to what we really are in truth.
this is the source of evangelized action.
why, if one welcomes this love that can re - give it the sense of his life, how can it curb in which the desire to pass it to others?
sweet and all evangelization fairs
the wealth itself always tends to spread.
any authentic experience of truth and beauty alone seeks to be broadened, and every person who undergoes a profound release gain higher sensibility to the needs of others.
when we share it with others, what is good to keep the roots and develop.
therefore, those who want to live in dignity and in full, do not have another choice except to recognise the other person and seek its wealth.
so we should not forget with these expressions of St Paul: "The love of Christ has drive us" (2 Cor 5: 14); "Storage for me if we do not proclaim the Gospel" (1 Cor 9: 16).
the proposal is to live at a higher level, but not at least intensity: "life we will strengthen it when we give it to others, and weaken it when we are killed for our ownselves and to store in comfort.
in fact, the most exploiting the possibilities of life are those who leave the shore and are given with themselves and their bodies for the mission to deliver life to others. "[4] When the Church calls for the commitment of evangelization, it would not be done anything except to show Christians the true dynamism of their personal realisation:" We discover another profound law of reality: life grows and mature according to how many others give it to the lives of others.
Finally, this is the mission. "[5] Mela, who evangelization should not have all the time of funeral.
let us rethinct and imprint in the hena sweet, which gives the power of evangelizer, even when we have dropped into the tear [...] I may be the great joy of our consecrated life.
and left the world of ourselves, who is looking, sometimes by sharing the heart, sometimes with hope, manages to receive the Good News not from an intense evangelizers, their hearts cut, un sabar and anxious, but from the ministers of the Gospel of a life bredged by the encouraged, who received the joy of Christ. "[6]
new eternal
a renewed announcement offers believers, even outdoors and those who do not practice faith, new joy in faith and evangelization that leaves fruit.
in reality, its core and essence is always the same: God who has shown his love without his regard in Christ who died and thrown.
he always threatens his faith, and even if they are elderly, get the strength, "pick up the wings like a few centuries, occur without defeating, moving without being thrown" (Is 40: 31).
Christ is "the Gospel of always" (Apok 14: 6), and he is "what he was, in the past, now and forever" (Jews 13: 8), but his wealth and beauty are endless.
it is always a young and a constant eye of the new.
the Church does not stop wearing with "the greatness, knowledge and unity of God" (Romans 11: 33).
Jesus Christ also has the ability to mislead the medocry schemes in which we expect that we should close it and all time surprising us with his divine creativity.
every time we seek to return to the eye to rebuild the original fresherence of the Gospel, new roads and creative methods, other forms of expression, more elocent signs, words filled with a renewed meaning for today' s world.
in reality, any authentic action of evangelization is always "new."
although this mission requires us a generous commitment, it would be an error if we see it as a piece of personal heroinism, because this option is foremost, to there from how much we have the ability to discover and understand we.
Jesus is "the first and the greatest evangelizer." [9] In all kinds of evangelization the primacy is always of God, who wanted us to work hand in his hand and said us strongly of his Spirit.
the new true is that God himself in a mysterious manner must create, what He turns us with it, what he said finely, what He will turn and herself in an eleph manner.
throughout the life of the Church it must always appear that the initiative is of God, "that" we have loved him "first (1 Jn 4: 10), and that he is" God who announced "(1 Cor 3: 7).
in this conviction we can keep the joy alive in a mission that requires us and challenge us because it commits our lives fully.
we ask us everything, but at the same time offer us everything.
nor should we understand the new element of this mission as if he would be something you want to be approached by the roots, herself must link the life story that was condemned in it and lead us forward.
memory is a dimension of our faith that we can call it "longteronomic," in similarity with the memory of Israel.
Jesus leaves us the Eucharist as a daily remembrance of the Church, which entered us increasingly in his Easter (see Lk 22: 19).
the joy of evangelization always plays on the background of grateful memory: this is a grace we need to pray it.
the apostles never forgotten that while Jesus touched to their heart: "It was a ten- hour prison" (Jn 1: 39).
together with Jesus, the memory brought us to us "a great partner of witnesses" (Jews 12: 1).
among them, we can recognize some who have influenced us especially so that it could be able to finate this joy of faith: "remember in those who lead you, those who felt you the word of God" (Jews 13: 7).
they were often simple and close to our people who have deprived us in faith life: "I remember in your true faith, faith that the first was of your Lojd and then of a Eucharist mother" (2 Tim 1: 5).
who believes is fundamentally "one who makes memory."
III.
new evangelization for the transmission of faith
collected in the spirit hearing, which helps us to recognise the signs of times, from 7 to 28 October 2012 met the XIII th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops with the theme New evangelization for the transmission of Christian faith.
this pastoral helps those who believe to continue to grow, in a way that responds always better and with all their lives to God' s love.
secondly, we remember in the area of "people who received Baptism who, but do not live according to what they ask them," [12] do not feel part of the Church and no longer feel the fairs of faith.
the Church, as an always careful mother, strive to pass through a conversion that rests them with the joy of faith and desire to take seriously the Gospel.
Finally, I argue that evangelization is essentially linked to the broadcasting of the Gospel to those who do not know Jesus Christ or who have always denied him.
many of them seek God with hidden, drive from nostalgia to his face, even in countries of ancient Christian tradition.
everyone has the right to receive the Gospel.
Christians are in duty to proclaim it without leaving someone outside, not like someone imposing a new obligation, but like those who are concerned with joy, shows it a beautiful desire, offer him a desired meal.
the Church is not proselitism grows, but "with the attractiveness." [13]
John Paul II invited us to recognise that "should never be reduced to the proclamation" to those who are sold by Christ, because "ultimately this is the first duty of the Church." [14] The missionary work "is today the best challenge that the Church has" [15] and "missionary work must be the first." [16] What happens if we really take these words seriously?
we recognise that missionary action is the model of every work of the Church.
proposal and limits of this Exemption
I prayed the invitation of the Synodal Paders to write this Exhortation. [19] I am doing so, we are gathering together the golden work made by the Synod.
I also consulted several people, and I would also like to express the concerns affecting me at this concrete moment of the work of evangelization of the Church.
they are without a number of issues related to evangelization in today' s world that I can develop here.
but I have failed to deal in a detailed manner these various arguments that should be the object of study and deepening.
nor I believe that one should expect from the Papal Mystery the latest word on all issues affecting the Church and the world.
it is not appropriate for the Pope to replace local Bishops in discernment of all problematics that arise in their territories.
in this sense, I feel the need to move towards "sana decentralisation."
here I chose to propose some guidelines that can make the heart to the whole Church and shape it towards a new step in evangelization, filled and dynamism.
in this framework, and in the framework of learning that gives us the Lumenatic Constitution gentium, I decided that, inter alia, a long - term short- term short on the following points:
I treat these topics in some detail that may perhaps be overloaded.
but this did not do so with a view to offering a treaty, but only to demonstrate the practical importance of these arguments in the work of the Church today.
in fact, as a whole they help to draw up a particular style of evangelization that I invite everyone to do in every work carried out.
so, in this way, we can welcome, in our daily work, what the Word of God prays: "Be always in the Lord; I will say to you, call!" (4: 4).
in God' s word we constantly see this dynamism of "exit" that God wishes to raise in believers.
Abraham welcomed the call to move to a new land (see Gen 12: 1 - 3).
Moses heard God' s call: "Let me, then, I will send you" (Ex 3: 10) and issued the people to the promised land (see Ex 3: 17).
to Jeremia ordered to him: "You go wherever you are sent to you" (Jer 1: 7).
today, in this "morre" of Jesus, we welcome the new scenarios and challenges of the Church' s mission to evangelize, and all we are called for this "issue" a new mission.
every Christian and every community must discern what is the way that the Lord is asking, but all we are called to welcome this call: we leave our commodities and have the courage to meet all the peripheries that need the light of the Gospel.
the joy of the Gospel to fill the life of the disciples community is a missionary joy.
I feel both and seven disciplines, which come back from the mission filled with joy (see Lk 10: 17).
they feel Jesus, which exceeds joy in the Holy Spirit and praises the Father to show himself to the poor and the smallest (see Lk 10: 21).
I feel it, they were amazed, the first people who had seen when hearing the prediocation of the Apostles "each in his own language" (Acts 2: 6) on Thursday.
this joy is a sign that the Gospel was announced and is making fruit.
but always has the dynamics of the exodus and don' t come from itself, to move and re - read, in an ever new dead.
the Lord says: "let us go elsewhere, in the villages of the nearby, let us also proclaim there, for so I was" (Mk 1: 38).
when the seeds have been lasered in a place, it was not able to get more there to better mean or to make other signs, because the Spirit leads it to other villages.
the word shall contain nobsruha powers.
the Gospel speaks about seeds which, when she was sowed, grow alone even if the farmer takes somnolence (see Mk 4: 26 - 29).
the Church should accept that the Word has this freedom to love, which is effective in its way, and with truly different forms from each other, so that we often protect us from under our own hands and crush our mental schemes.
the Church' s intimacy with Jesus is an incinerating intimacy, and the community "from its own nature conceives missionary proclamation." [20] I have faithful to the model of the Boss, it is essential that today the Church issues to announce the Gospel to all, everywhere, on every occasion, without being disrupted, without any fear of being denied it and fearful.
the joy of the Gospel is for the whole people, it can leave someone out.
so we announce the angel to the shepherd of Bethlehem: "Do not swallow, because they arose, I am joying you great joy, joy that will be for the whole people" (Lk 2: 10).
the apocalissi speaks about "the Gospel of always to proclaim those who grow on the ground, to every gens, tribe, tongue and people" (Apok 14: 6).
we take the initiative, get our soul, join, make fruit and shooting
the Church that "issues" is the community of missionary disciplines taking an initiative, involving themselves, to join others, making fruit and shooting.
"Primeerear - we take the initiative": I ask you to use me for this neologism.
the Community that evangelizes that the Lord is what the initiative has taken, he brought her in love (see 1 Jn 4: 10), and so she knows the first step, you may take the initiative without fearing, meet others, looking for the promised and arriving up to the cross roads to invite the steam.
live with the desirelessly to offer mercy, and this comes from the fact that it itself has played by the infinite mercy of the Father and his unfounded power.
let us get a little more initiative!
as a consequence, the Church knows "is involved."
Jesus felt his disciples.
the Lord involves himself and involves those of which they are his, fall down to him before others to escape them.
but a right after he tells his disciples: "If these things have lost them, we are if you do them" (Jn 13: 17).
the evangelized Community, with crops and managed, enters into the daily life of others, shorten distances, lowered to the humiliation point if necessary, and embrace human life, touch the body of Christ that suffer in its people.
evangelizers therefore have the "odour of sheep" and they hear their voice.
therefore, the evolving community offers itself to "partner."
join humanity in all the steps it has served, are both hard and long.
you know what you mean long - term and able to embark in the Apostolic trib.
evangelization works very found, and does not close her eyes for limitations.
faith towards the gift of the Lord, you know even how "make fruit."
the evangelization Community is always attending to fruit, because the Lord has to make a waste.
it takes care of wheat and does not lose the peace of her heart due to the bowel.
what we read, when you see the gut is lightened to the wheat, neither jgää nor discourage itself.
it finds a way in which the Word keeps it in a concrete situation in order to give the fruit of a new life, even if it appears imperfect or not full.
the disciples may offer all his life and risk it to the martyrdom as witnesses of Jesus Christ, but his dream is not to be filled with enemies, but even more that the Word is welcomed and show its hardness to renew everything.
Finally, the community that evangelizes with joy knows how "shooting" always.
celebrate and make a feast for every small victory, every step forward in evangelization.
the joy evangelization shows her beauty in the Liturgy in the context of the need to see that it is disseminated and increase wealth.
the Church evangelizes and receives evangelization from the beauty of the Liturgy, because it is also a celebration of the work of evangelization and a renewed source of energy to be given.
I know that today the documents do not drive the same interest as in the past, and quickly dispose of.
however, I insist that what I want to express here has a programme meaning and important consequences.
I hope that all communities strive to employ the necessary means to move forward in the journey of pastoral and missionary conversion, which cannot leave things as they found them.
there is no need for "simple administration." [21] In all regions of the world we need to set up a presence in a permanent state of mission. "[22]
Paul VI invited us to broaden the call for renewal, and expressed this strongly that it was not addressed only to individuals, but to the whole Church.
without a new life and an authentic evangelical spirit, without the "faithfulness of the Church to its same vocation," any new structure within a short period will be deleted from inside.
ecclesial renewal that press on us
I am glad to make a missionary choice capable of changing anything, so that habits, styles, times, language and any ecclesial structure become a good channel for the evangelization of today' s world, rather than for self - preservation.
the reform of structures, which requires pastoral conversion, we can understand it only in this light: we make all these more missionaries, that ordinary pastoral at all its levels is broader and open, which puts pastoral agents in a continuous attitude of "exit" and thus favour the positive answer of all those to them Jesus offers his friendship.
as John Paul II said to the Bishops of the Oceania, "any renewal in the Church should have as his goal the mission, not to be a pretext of attitude where the Church looks only to itself." [25]
the parish is not a structure with united days; propium due to its flexibility, may take different forms from each other calling for the sweetness and missionary creativity of the shepherd and the community.
even if it is certainly not the only evangelized institution, if it has the ability to reform itself and adapt itself all the time, it will continue to be "the Church to equip them in the middle of her children' s homes." [26] This requires it that it is actually in contact with the families and the lives of the people and does not become a structure that is lost in many speech but then cut by people, or a group of selected who have taken their own mind alone.
but we must recognise that the call for review and renewal of parishes has not yet given sufficient fruit to bring them closer to people, and be a dead of a living community and participation, and redouble themselves towards the mission.
the other ecclesial institutions, base communities and small communities, movements and other forms of associations, are rich for the Church that the Spirit is driving to evangelize all the environments and areas.
many times we have suffered a new impetus for evangelization and ability to dialogue with the world renewing the Church.
but it is worth great wealth if they do not lose contact with this reality so richness of the parish of the place, and to integrate themselves with all joy in the organic pastoral of the particular Church. [29] This integration avoid remaining only part of the Gospel and the Church, or changing into a rooted noma.
each particular Church, part of the Catholic Church under the leadership of its Bishop, is also called for missionary conversion.
it is the subject of evangelization, [30] because it is the concrete manifestation of a single Church in a particular place in the world, and in which "the Church of Christ is present and active, one, Saint, Catholic and Apostolic." [31] It is the Church marked in a determined space, rewarded by all means of salvation of Christ, but with a local face.
the Bishop should always strive for the missionary community in his diocesan Church by moving on the ideal of the first Christian communities, where those believing were one heart and one soul (see Acts 4: 32).
therefore, there is sometimes a need to move forward to show the way and store the hope of the people, while sometimes simply moving heart everyone by simply and full mercy stand close to them, and in some circumstances should follow after the people, to help those who fell back and - above all - to keep her hunger what he does to keep he so that you can search and find new roads.
in his mission to a living, open and missionary community, it should encourage and seek the growth of participating organisms proposed by the Canonic Law Code [34] and other trends of pastoral dialogue, with the desire to listen to all and not only some, who are always willing to complement it.
but the main objective of these participation processes should not be the ecclesial organisation, but the missionary dream that reaches all.
I have neither been called to live what I ask from others, I also want to think in the conversion of the papat.
he is in my duty, as Bishop of Rome, that I am open to the suggestions that enter into the functioning of my ministry in a way that makes it more faithful to the meaning that he wanted to give him Jesus Christ and to the needs of evangelization today.
Pope John Paul II asked to be assisted to find a form of operation of the primacy which, while in no way rejecting what is essential in his mission, is opened to a new situation. "[35] In this sense we have raised us forward.
even the papat and central structures of the universal Church need to hear this call for pastoral conversion.
the Pastoral in a missionary light requires us to leave the comfortable pastoral criterion of "because it has always been done."
I invite everyone to be courageous and creative in our work to rebuild the objectives, structures, style and methods of evangelization in our communities.
if we try to launch our objectives without first seeking properly at Community level the means to achieve them, we are condemning us for a simple fantasy.
I encourage everyone to apply with generosity and care the orientations of this document, without hindrance or fear.
it is important that we are not alone, who rely always on our fish and especially on the light that we give you the bishops, in a rich and realistic pastoral discernment.
if we want to do everything in a missionary light, it also applies to the way in which the message is delivered.
in today' s world, with the speed of the means of communication and the choice of the content it makes the average, the message we announce is facing more than ever before the risk that it appears distorted and reduced to some of its secondary aspects.
this is why some issues that are part of the moral learning of the Church remain outside the context of giving them sense.
the biggest problem is when the message we announce we then appears identified with some side aspects that, although relevant, alone do not reveal the core of the message of Jesus Christ.
therefore, we need to be realistic and we do not expect those receiving our message to know what is the full context of what we are saying and that we can link our speech with the essential core of the Gospel that gives him the sense and beauty of which you draw.
Pastoral with a missionary style is not obsolete to seek to impose insistence the transmission of a number of doctrines separated from each other.
when we have a pastoral target and missionary style, which really reach everyone without exception or exclusion, the announcement concentrates on what is essential, on what is the most beautiful, most attractive and at the same time as the most necessary.
the proposal is made simply, without losing anything from its depth and truth, making it more convincing and strong.
all the truths reveled come from the same divine eye and believe them with the same faith, but some of them are more important to give us more directly to the heart of the Gospel.
in this fundamental core he hope the beauty of God' s faithful love that appeared in Jesus Christ who died and thrown.
in this sense, the Vatican Council II stated that "in the Catholic doctrine there is an order or 'hierarchy' of truths because diversa is their connection with the foundation of Catholic faith." [38] This is true both for faith and the collection of Church learning, inter alia its moral learning. "
St. Aquino' s Tumas believed that even in the moral message of the Church there is hierarchy, in the viruses and crops arising from it. [39] What is true "the faith that works through love" (Gal 5: 6).
now this is especially a duty of the superior, so that it is a quality of God to demonstrate mercy, and is especially in this which he shows his power to everything. "[41]
it is important to see what the pastoral consequences of the teaching of the Council, which encompasses a holistic conviction that the Church has.
first, it must be said that in the Gospel' s broadcasting it is necessary a good sense of consideration.
this is seen in the frequency under which certain themes are mentioned and what is the most pressing in the prediocation.
for example, if during the liturgical year a capillan speaks ten times on temperatures and only three or three on charity or justice, there is a lack of balance, where those who end up in the shade are well overwhelming the virtues that should most be present in prediocation and catechesis.
the same happens when speaking more about the law than about grace, more about the Church than Jesus Christ, more about the Pope than about the Word of God.
as a result of the unity between the virtues we cannot exclude any of them from the Christian ideal, no truth can be rejected.
we should not be reduced from the beauty of the Gospel' s message.
Moreover, every truth is better understood if it was placed in relation to the harmonious totality of the Christian message, and in this context all the truths have their importance and surround each other.
when the prediocation is a faithful for the Gospel, it is clearly apparent that the centrality of some truths and it is clear that the Christian moral prediocation is not an ethics Stoic, is more than abscesses, it is not simple philosophy nor a list of sins and errors.
the Gospel has foremost called for a response to God who loves us and saves us, to recognize it in others and to leave us ourselves we will seek the good of all.
this invitation should never and in no circumstances be hindered!
all the virtues are for the service of this love response.
if this invitation does not tmax strongly and in a way that draws, the moral building of the Church would risk ending a card castle, and this is the greatest danger we have.
for then it is not exactly the Gospel we are announcing, but some doctrine or moral accent arising from specific ideological choices.
the message is at risk of losing his frescient and no longer the fragrance of the Gospel. "
the Church, which is a missionary disciple, needs to grow in its interpretation of the Word reveled and in the way the truth understands.
the work of the arts and theologists helps to mature "The judgement of the Church." [42] This makes it even the other sciences in their way.
for example, when he spoke about social sciences, John Paul II said that the Church looks at their contribution "to seeking concrete indications that help it carry out the mission of its mystery." [43] In addition, within the Church there are a number of issues on which it investigates and reflects with great freedom.
if we leave the Spirit, together with respect and love the various lines of philosophical ,ological and pastoral thought, they can help the Church grow, to better explicit the too rich treasury of the Word.
for those who dreamed with a monolytic doctrine protected by everyone without any shades, this may appear an imperfect shooting.
but the truth is that this variety helps to appear and develop better the various aspects of the rich without taking into account the Gospel. [44]
at the same time, major and balanced cultural changes call for us to be careful at all times to try to express the truths that were always in a language that allows knowledge of what is permanently new in them.
for, in the deposit of Christian doctrine, "the sutance is something [...], and the way in which its expression is formulated is something else." [45] Some times, when the faith hears a fully orthodox language, what they arrive, because in the language they use and understand, it is something that does not agree with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
with all the holy intention to give them the truth about God and man, on some occasions we are counting them a false or human ideal that is not truly Christian.
in this way, we will be faithful towards a particular formulation but we are not moving the substance.
this is the worst risk.
we keep in mind that "the expression of truth may have several forms, and the renewal of the forms of expression is necessary to pass to today' s human beings the Gospel' s message within its meaning that it does not change." [46]
this is very true for the broadcasting of the Gospel, if it is true for us that his beauty is more understandable and welcomed by all.
what is, the Church' s learning has never been able to get it easily understandable and appreciated by everyone without any problem.
the faith always carries with it a cross aspect, some shadow that does not remove anything from its acceptance power.
there are things we can understand them and appreciate them only if we leave this acceptance that is honoured love, there is clear from the clarity in which we can understand the reasoning and arguments.
it is therefore important to recall that every teaching of doctrine should look at it with an attitude of evangelization that, if we live with him by seeking to be always close to others, with love and witnesses, driving the heart to believe.
in its continuous discernment, the Church may also arrive at recognising that there are some habits which are not directly linked to the heart of the Gospel, some of which have been rooted well with the history path, and that now they must not be interpreted in the same way and their message are normally no longer well understood.
they can be beautiful, but now no longer give the same service to the transmission of the Gospel.
we should not be able to revoke them.
in the same way, there are norms or precipes of the Church which could have been very effective in other times, but that today no longer have done the same educational power as life channels.
we should consider it as a criterion when we think about a reform of the Church and its prediocation that helps it truly reach all.
therefore, without deducting anything from the value of the Gospel' s ideal, we need to accompany mercy and find the maturity steps of people who build a day after the other. [50] to the priests remind them that the confessionary should not be a room of torture but the mercy of the Lord that we want to do the greatest possible wealth.
a tiny step, heart the great human limitations, can be go further to God from life - which out of the outside seems good - of who pass his life without ever confronting with important difficulties.
everyone must reach the garages and encourage God' s trustful love, which works in a mysterious manner in every person, there is from its defects and falls.
we see that the commitment to evangelization is somewhere between language limits and circumstances.
it always seeks to better deliver the truth of the Gospel in a particular context, without saying not to truth, wealth and light that it can get when perfection is not possible.
missionary heart knows with these limits and becomes "weak with the weak [...] everything with everyone" (1 Cor 9: 22).
never closed itself, never seeks its own securities, never selecting the hardness of its defence itself.
you know that she himself needs to grow in the knowledge of the Gospel and in the discernment of the paths of the Spirit, and then never tell no to the good that can be done, rather than ready to enter the risk of marble by road mud.
the Church that "issues" is a Church with its doors open.
it comes to others to reach human peripheralies does not mean going to the world without any direction or sense of free.
it is often better if you move more slowly, escape anxiety, so you can look in the eyes of man and hear, or leave it what appears urgent to join the remaining road side.
it is often like the father of the son of the brothers, who keeps his doors open to return, it can enter free of charge.
the Church is called to be the open house of the Father.
one of the concrete signs of this opening is that we have everywhere churches with their doors open.
so, if someone wants to move according to the Spirit and move to God, you don' t have to face him with the cold of a closed door.
but there are other doors that should not be left closed.
everyone can in any way participate in the life of the Church, everyone can be part of the community, nor the doors of the Sacrament shall not be closed for reason it is to be.
this applies above all when we talk about that sacrament that is "the door," Baptism.
the Eucharist, even if it is the milestone of sacramental life, is not a prize for perfect only, but it is strong and food for the boat. [51] This conviction also has pastoral consequences that we are called to be considered prudently and courage.
we often bring our soul as we have been monitoring grace and not as those that facilitate it.
but the Church is not customs, it is the house of the Father where there is a place for all, each with his hard life.
if the whole Church makes this missionary dynamism, it needs to reach all, without any exception.
but who should be its shipment?
when reading the Gospel, it meets a very clear orientation: not friends and neighbours rich, as much as all the poor and sick, those who are often myself and forgotten, those who do not have where you pay you pleasure "(Lk 14: 14).
there should be no doubt and there are no explanations to distribute this message so clear.
today and always, "the poor are the privileged consignee of the Gospel," [52] and the evangelization to be given free is a sign of our Kingdom that Jesus had led.
we need to stress without shaping words that there is an inseparable link between our faith and the poor.
I don' t leave them alone.
let us leave, let us leave to offer all the lives of Jesus Christ.
in the meantime for the whole Church what I often helped the priests and the Laity of Buenos Aires: I prefer a Church brought up, joy and dirty because they come out on the streets, from a marid Church with the closure and comfort of the certainties with which it is greeted.
I don' t want a Church mind that it is at the centre and finishes closed in a confection of obsitions and procedures.
if there is something that with all the reason we should worry and our consciousness is that so many of our fish are living without power, the light and fairs of friendship with Jesus Christ, without a community of faith to which they are vaccinated should, without any move of sense and life.
rather than the fear that what we protect us is the fear of being closed in the structures that give you false protection, in the norms that we change us in mercyless judges, in the habits in which we feel a tranquillion, while there is outside a large crowd and Jesus who are sheltered us undoubtedly: "How do you eat" (Mk 6: 37).
before speaking on some fundamental issues affecting the action of evangelization, it is appropriate to remind in short what is the context in which we live and work.
we often listen to "diagnostic surplus," which is not always a partner of truly applied solution proposals.
on the other hand, it is neither sufficient a purely sociological look, which states that it can understand all the reality with its methodology that is hypothetically neutral and clinical.
what I want to offer here rather is in the evangelical discernment line.
it' s the view of the missionary disciple that "we can sing with the light and power of the Holy Spirit." [53]
it is not the Pope to offer a detailed and full analysis of contemporary reality, but calls on each community to have "The ability to look around it, to give itself to felt about the signs of ourselves." [54] This is a great responsibility, because some realities of our time, if they do not find good solutions, may drive disumanisation processes which then difficult to return them.
it is appropriate to clarify what is the fruit of the Kingdom and even what goes against God' s plan.
this does not only mean that we recognise and interpret the heavyness of the good spirit and the bad spirit, but - and here is the decisive element - to choose that of the right spirit and to reject that of the bad spirit.
we leave from the basis of several studies already offering other universal mystery documents, such as regional and national Episcopal Conferences proposals.
in this Exemption, my thought is to shorten only, with a pastoral view to some aspects of the realities that may limit or undermine the dynamics of missionary renewal of the Church, both because they affect the life and dignity of the people of God, and because they influence those who directly belong to the institutions of the Church and carry out evangelization tasks.
today human lives a historical change that we can see it in the progress that is taking place in many areas.
it is worth praising the various successes improving people' s quality of life, for example in the field of health, education and communication.
but we cannot forget that most men and women are living every day in a critical situation, with terrible consequences.
some diseases are increasing.
the fear and disperation is fleeing many people, even in the so - called rich countries.
it is often forgotten that joy of life, it is continuing to appoint the lack of respect and violence, while increasingly reflecting the lack of equality.
one has to third to live and, often, to live with at least a little dignity.
this focal change is caused by huge quality advances, quantity, speed and cumulation that took place in scientific progress, technological inventions and their rapid application in many areas of nature and life.
we are in the era of knowledge and dissemination of information, a source of new trends of power which often has no name.
not for an exclusion economy
the same as the commandment 'does not kill "puts us a clear limit to ensure the value of human life, today it needs to say" no for an exclusion economy and the lack of equality. "
this type of economy kills.
how can the death of a senior to the cross of the road where he was living does not appear in news, so that the market shares were then shown by two points?
this means exclusion.
we can no longer tolerate the fact that there are those who are fleeing food, when there are people suffering hunger.
this is the lack of equality.
now everything enters into the competitiveness and law game of the strongest, where the strongest swallows the weakest.
as a consequence, we have large parts of the population that are excluded and marginalised: without work, without future, without possibilities.
the man in itself is considered to be a consumption product, which can use it and then dispose of it.
we have created a "waste culture" and we are even promoting it.
this is no longer simply a phenomenon of exploitation and oppression, but here we have something new: exclusion is affecting in the same roots the sense of belonging to the society in which we live, as those excluded is not only in its mandates, periphery, or without power, but even left out of it.
those excluded are not only "exploited" but are the extra, "for disposal."
in this context, there are still cleaning (trickle - down theories) theories of an economic strategy aimed at reducing taxes, in order to incentivise individuals and businesses to work more.
according to these, any economic growth, assisted by the free market, has the ability to produce itself greater equality and social inclusion in the world.
this view, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a goat and ingenous trust in terms of economic power and in the idealised mechanisms of the moment' s economic system.
meanwhile, those left out, remain waiting.
a globalisation of the indifference that is storing this lifestyle which excludes others, or encourages further this ecgoistic ideal.
almost without writing, we will lose the ability to imagine mercy before the carba of the other pain, we will no longer continue to continue before the suffering of others, nor do we intend to take care of them, as it was a responsibility not to touch us and for us is foreign.
the culture of wealth and wealth will become a loophisticating and shelter if the market offers something new that we have not yet bought, while these lives rooted from any possibility for us become simple spectacle that in no way we are still coming to us.
No for the new idradiation of money
one of the causes of this situation is found in the relationship we have created us with money, where we are unrestricted their brother on us and our society.
the ongoing financial crisis is tightening that there is a deep antropological crisis: the denial of human primacy!
we created new idles.
the old gold calves worship (see Ex 32: 1 - 35) has now found a new and un mercyful version in the idolry of money and in the dictatorship of a facial and unintended economy.
the global crisis affecting finance and the economy is uncovering the same lack of balance contained therein and, above all, the severe lack of antropological orientation that the human needs need to be: consumption.
while the little is always gaining more exaggeratedly, many find themselves increasingly distant from the wealth of these few being well being.
this imbalance has emerged from ideologies whose mind is defending the absolute autonomy of the market and financial speculation.
it therefore does not accept the right of control by the Member States, whose work is to protect the common good.
it is thus set up a new reintroduction that does not appear, sometimes virtual, imposing its laws and rules unilaterally and without mercy.
Moreover, its debts and interests sell countries from the practicable possibilities of their economy and citizens from the real power of their acquisition.
with all this then we add corruption and tax evasion, which today find them spread across the world.
the kidney for power and wealth does not know with limits.
in this system, which is capable of being slaughtered all in his way to achieve more, every thing that is weak, such as the environment, must not be defended against the interests of the market 'decompanied, "which are the absolute rule.
No for money commanding instead play
after this attitude there is hidden the denial of ethics and denial of God.
the ethics usually look at it with certain stars.
we see it work urine, because it is too human, and relate to money and power.
we look at it as a threat, because they order the manipulation and collection of the person.
there is no doubt that ethics point to God who expects us a commitment answer, which is found to there from market categories.
when they are given absolute value, they look at God as something that cannot control it, manipulate it, and that even is dangerous, once he calls on man for his full media and for freedom from all kinds of slavery.
ethics that are not ideology - leave a width for a more human balance and social order.
in this sense, I call on financial experts and those who manage the governments of several countries to take account of one words of the lambs of the unemployed: "Do not share your wealth with the poor means that they are hot and deprive them of life.
the wealth we have in our hands is not ourselves, but their. "[55]
a financial reform that does not ignore the ethics calls for a strong change of attitude on the part of political leaders, which ask them to tackle this challenge with determination and vision for the future, without neglecting, of course, the specific context.
money is there to play and not to lead!
the Pope loves all, rich and poor, but has the obligation, on behalf of Christ, to remind that rich must help the poor, respect them and encourage them.
I encourage you to show disguised solidarity to return to an economy and a financial system surrounded by ethics in favour of human beings.
non- equality of violence
today in many parts of the world we are listening to the need for further security.
but unless the exclusion and lack of equality in society and between the various peoples, it is impossible to eradicate violence.
the poor and the most poor people are accused of violence, but, without equality of opportunities, the various forms of fighting and war find fertile land that today or tomorrow brings explosion.
where society - local, national or global - is part of it in the periphery, political programmes, order forces or intelligence seeking to ensure long - term tranquillity.
this is not only because the lack of equality raises the violent reaction of those excluded from the system, but also because the social and economic system is unfair from its own roots.
the same as the right itself seeks to spread, so the evil to tolerate, i. e. injustice, seeks to disseminate its killings and without much noise earning from their roots the foundations of any political and social system, it appears as strong as possible.
if any action has its consequences, evil which has infiltrated into society structures always has a power to crush and kill.
it is the evil that we find in unfair social structures, and therefore they cannot expect a better future.
we are far away from the so - called "end of history," neither the conditions for sustainable and peaceful development have not yet been established and properly carried out.
the mechanisms of our time promote unexpected consumption, but we see how consumption has been done, together with the lack of equality, are damaging to social fabric.
so it happens that the social imbalance today or tomorrow causes violence that the exhibition for armaments is neither solving nor ever solved.
this serves only to try to mislead those who are calling for more security, as if we do not know that arms and violence, instead lead to solutions, create new and worse conflicts.
some simply enjoy the guilt of their evil on the poor and poor countries, with free generalisations in their place, and expect that they will find the solution in 'education "that calculate them and forget them not to harm them.
this becomes more irritant if the exclusive sees this social cancer that is corruption rooted so thick in these countries - in governments, among entrepreneurs and institutions - is what is the political ideology of the leadership.
some cultural challenges
we would also be evangelized when we seek to tackle the number of challenges that may arise. [56] They appear in real attacks against religious freedom or in new situations of persecution against Christians, which, in some countries, have reached worrying levels of hate and violence.
in many places rather we see a spread of relative indifference, related to disillsion and the crisis of ideologies as a response to all that appears totalitarian.
this is not the Church only damages, but to the social life as a whole.
we need to understand that in a culture where every person wishes to embrace its subjective truth, it is made diffilient that citizens want to offer their share in a common project that goes beyond the interests and personal wishes.
in the dominant culture, the first place takes what is foreigners, immediately, appears out of the outside, fast, superficial, provisional.
the real proceeds his place to what appears.
in many countries, short globalisation has returned cultural roots, invoking ideas from other cultures, economically developed but ethically weak.
so we understand a number of Synods of Bishops in several continents.
African Bishops, for example, some years ago have reaped the Sollicitudo rei socialis Encyclical, and said that there are often those who want to change Africa' s countries in a simple "pieces of mechanism, part of a giant device.
this is often also seen in the field of social communication, which, in most cases, are in the hands of top centres of the world, do not always take sufficient account of the priorities and problems of these countries nor respect their cultural physiion. "[57] Similarly, Asian Bishops have been wearing on" the influences that are entered outside Asian cultures.
new trends of behaviour which are the fruit of extra exposure to the means of communication [...] As a consequence, the negative aspects of the medium and entertainment industries threaten traditional values. "[58]
the Catholic faith of many people today found itself face with the challenge of disseminating new religious movements, some move to fundamentalism and others appear to be proposing Godless spirituality.
on the one hand, this is the result of a human response to the materialist, consumer and individualist society, but, on the other hand, they are a way to take advantage of the weakness of people living in the peripheries and poor areas, who live a great human pain and seek rapid solutions to their needs.
these religious movements, which inspire for the subtle way of filtering, try to fill the gap that leaves the secularist rationalism in a culture where individualism has been met.
above all, we need to recognise that, if among our shedding there is no one who does not feel part of the Church, it also knows it to some structures and climate that is not so vaccination in some of our parishes and communities, or bureaucratic attitude in response to problems, simple or complicated, of the lives of our people.
in many areas, the administrative aspect is wearing on pastoral, and the same is happening with sacramentalisation caused by other forms of evangelization.
the secularisation process seeks to limit faith and the Church for the private framework and you are.
Moreover, when rejecting any descent, he has led to growing ethical deformation, to discourage the sense of personal and social sins, and to an increasing increase of relativeism.
they bring them a general sense of disorientation, especially in the adhesive and youth phase, so vulnerable due to ongoing changes.
as well as the Bishops of the United States of America, while the Church insists that there are objective moral norms, which apply to all, "there are those who present this learning as unfair, or contrary to fundamental human rights.
these types of arguments normally come from a form of moral relativeism, joining, not inconsistent, with confidence in the absolute rights of individuals.
in this optics, the Church seems to promote particular prejudice and is itself interfering in freedom of what is. "[59] I live in a bombardan information society with information without distinguishing, and endowing us to a great surface when we are asked to make moral questions.
it is therefore necessary to learn critically and offer a journey where we are mature in those values.
despite the secularist current with which our societies, in a number of countries - even where Christianity is in a minority - the Catholic Church is a credible institution in the eyes of the public opinion, which may trust it with regard to the area of solidarity and the protection of the poorest.
on several occasions, it has made a mediator to reach a solution to problems affecting peace, agreement, environment, protection of life, human and civil rights, etc.
and how great the contribution of schools and Catholic universities worldwide!
this is very positive.
despite this, we are born many suffering to show that, when we come to bring forward other issues that are not so much welcomed by the public, we do so with faithfulness to our same convictions on the dignity of the human person and the common good.
the family, like all other communities and social links, is undergoing a strong cultural crisis.
in the case of the family, the weakness of the links is particularly serious because we have a fundamental cell of society, elsewhere where we learn to live with the differences of ourselves and we are each other and where parents pass faith to children.
the tendency has been to look at marriage as a simple form of affective gratification that can be built in any way and change according to how it feels that it is.
but the indispensable contribution of marriage to society is above the emotional level and the changing needs of the couple.
as the French Bishops teach, this is not born "from the feeling of love, which by definition is a passing, but from the depth of the commitment to take the spouses to accept entering a whole life community." [60]
local and globalised individualism favours a lifestyle that undermines the development and stability of the links between people, and fear those familiar with their true nature.
from pastoral action it should be made clear that the relationship with Father requests and urges a cure community, promote and strengthen interpersonal relations.
while in the world, especially in some countries, several forms of wars and conflicts are emerging, we are Christians continue to insist on the proposal we know to the other person, who have launched wounds, building bridges, building relationships and helping each other "to swallow each other" (Gal 6: 2).
on the other hand, many forms of rights protection organisations and to achieve too noble objectives.
in this way, the aim is to contribute to the participation of many citizens wishing to be shelters of social and cultural progress.
challenges for the inclusion of faith
Christian boys of some people - especially in the west - are a life reality.
here we find, especially among those most in need, a moral resource that protects the values of authentic Christian humanism.
if we look at the reality with the eyes of faith, we cannot know what we are reading the Holy Spirit.
we don' t show trust in his greet and generous knowledge if we think there is no authentic Christian values where a large part of the rich population of Baptism and expresses its faith and fraternal solidarity in a number of ways.
here we need to recognise that there is much more than the "Verb seed," because here we are authentic Catholic faith that in its ways it expresses itself and appeals to the Church.
it is not right to ignore the decisive importance of having a culture marked by faith, since this evangelized culture, despite its limits, to the attacks of today' s secularism has much more resources than the mere number of believers.
a popular evangelized culture carries out values of faith and solidarity which can lead to the development of a fairer society and which believes, and has particular knowledge that we should look at it with gratitude.
it is essential to evangelize cultures in which we grow the Gospel.
in the countries of Catholic tradition this is done to accompany, care and strengthen the already existing richness, and in the countries of other or fully secularised religious traditions we need to seek new processes of evangelization of culture, even if they call for long - term work plans.
however, we cannot ignore that we are always called to grow.
each culture and each social group needs to be mitigated and mature.
in the case of popular cultures of Catholic peoples, we must write with some weaknesses that still need to be expressed by the Gospel: maskylism, alcohol, domestic violence, scarce participation in Eucharist, fatalist or superscious belief leading to the right to the warmest, and others.
but it is the popular property the best starting point towards their healing and freedom.
it is also true that sometimes the accent, rather than on the power of Christian faith, is placed on foreign forms of traditions of some groups, or on alleged private revelations to be absolute.
there is a certain Christian built on devotions, whether individually and sentimental way of living faith, which in reality does not agree with an authentic "popular property."
some promote these expressions without interrupting them from social promotion or the formation of faith, and in some cases it do so to gain economic benefits or any form of power on others.
we cannot consider that, in the last decades, there was a cut in the transmission of Christian faith from generation to the other of the Catholic people.
we cannot be forgotten that many are feeling deluous and no longer identify themselves with the Catholic tradition, which are increasing parents who do not admit their children and do not teach them, and that there are many who are leaving the Church and seek other faith communities.
among the causes leading to this divide we find the lack of spaces for family dialogue, the influence of the media of communication, relative subjectiveism, consumption has been encouraged by the market, the lack of pastoral accompany of the poor, the lack of reception in our institutions, and our difficulty of restoring faith in a realistic manner within a scenario composed of several religions.
challenges of urban cultures
Jerusalem the new, the Holy city (see Apok 21: 2 - 4), is the destination to which the whole humanity is moving.
interesting that the Revelation tells us that the world of humanity and history is still carried out in a city.
we need to know what is this city by leaving a contemplative look, or better, a look of faith that finds that God living in its homes, on its roads, in its breeds.
the presence of God has partner the sincere search of persons and groups to find help and sense in their lives.
he hears citizens and urges them for solidarity, fraternity, the desire for goodness, truth, justice.
this presence should not be invented, but disseminated, shown.
God is not brought before those who seek him with sincere heart, even if they do it read, not completely precise, or how it was.
in the city, religious aspect undergoes a number of lifestyles, habits linked to a sense of time, territory and relationships which differ from the style of people living in the campaign.
in everyday life citizens often have to struggle to live and, in this connection, there is a deep sense of knowledge of life which normally implies a strong religious sense.
we want to examine it to enter into a dialogue such as what the Lord did with the Samaritana, thanks to the beer, where she went to seek to fight her thirst (see Jn 4: 7 - 26).
new cultures continue to be created in these large human pastures where Christian is no longer what reads and gives sense, but they receive is a language, symbols, messages and other models offering other directions in life, often in contrast to the Gospel of Jesus.
in the city we start and is shaping a new culture.
the Synod stated that today changes in these large places and the culture they express are a preferred place of the new evangelization. [61] This requires us to seek to create prayers and community spaces with new features, attracting the eye and have a meaning for urban peoples.
because of the influence of mass media, neither the rural environments are foreign for these cultural changes which bring them even significant differences in the way people live.
evangelization is needed to illuminate us in new ways of entering into relation to God, others and the environment, and to show us what are the fundamental values.
there is a need to find out where new discounts and models are being shaped, we are met with the Word of Jesus the most profoundness of the city.
we do not want to forget that the city is a environment of many cultures.
in the large cities a tissue connecting groups of people with the same dreams for life and similar imagination, and where new invisible areas are shown, cultural territories and cities.
different cultural trends live each other, but often exercise segregation practices and violence.
the Church is called for the service of a hard dialogue.
on the other hand, there are citizens seeking the appropriate means of developing their personal and family life, but many are those who "are not citizens," are "half citizens" or are the "city' s sword."
the city creates a trend of permanent ambiguity, because, while offering its citizens a unfounded number of possibilities, it appears also to be many difficulties in the full development of many lives.
this contradiction carries her tenant suffering.
in many areas of the world, cities are mass protests scenarios where thousands of people are demanding freedom, participation, justice and several other questions that, if they are not well understood, a meal can be blocked using force.
we can' t have an eye for drug trafficking and people, for the abuse and exploitation of minors, for the desirability of the elderly and sick, and for many other forms of corruption and crime we have in our cities.
at the same time, what could be a precious space of a meeting and solidarity, is often transformed into a shrink and stick from both sides in each other.
housing and headquarters are built to isolate and protect from linking and connecting together.
the Gospel' s broadcasting should be the framework on which the dignity of human life is restored in these contexts, because Jesus even in cities want to live with the cotra (see Jn 10: 10).
the united and full sense of human life proposing the Gospel is the best solution to the city' s evil, even if we want to keep in mind that a uniform and rigid programme and style of evangelization are not good for this reality.
but if you live in depth what is human and enter the heart of the challenges as a yeast to give evidence, in every culture, in every city, the Christian will be improved he and make fruit even in the city.
attempts by pastoral operators
I feel that I have to demonstrate a great gratitude towards the commitment of all those working within the Church.
here I don' t want to list the tasks of the large number of pastoral operators, bishops to the smallest and most hidden among ecclesial services.
I would like to reflect on the challenges they all want to face in the context of our globalised culture.
but I want to say, firstly and with a sense of justice, that part of the Church in today' s world is huge.
I thank God for the beautiful example that I give me so Christian who offer their lives and time with joy.
this witness is of great wealth for me and restraint in the personal desire to overcome my self -ism to get more.
however, as a child of our epoka, all in some way we influenced by today' s globalised culture, which, even if we place before us new values and possibilities, can also limit us, conditioning and even tracking us.
Yes to the missionary spirituality challenge
today, in many pastoral operators, including consecrated persons, we are confronted with an exaggerated concern for their personal spaces of autonomy and rest, leading them to their duties seem simple to increase life, as if they did not belong to their identity.
at the same time, spiritual life agrees with some religious moments that offer certain rest but do not encourage meeting with others, for the commitment in the world, to the passion for evangelization.
so, in many evangelization operators, even if they request, we meet with an excessive accentation of individualism, an identity crisis and a brush in the hedge.
they are three types of evil that spend one another.
sometimes in the media culture and in some intellectual environments we welcome particular emphasis on the Church' s message, as well as a certain delusion.
as a result, several pastoral operators, despite prayer, foster a certain sense of inferiority, leading them to relate to or escape their Christian identity and convictions.
thus creating a vicious circle, because they are then not happy with what they are and what they do, do not feel able to identify themselves with the evangelization mission, which weakens their commitment.
end up to halt the joy of the mission with species of obstruction to be like all others and to have what others should.
in this way, the work of evangelization is forced and devote it little efforts and very limited time.
there is from the spiritual style or the particular line of thought they may have, develop in certain pastoral operators relative to which more than doctrine risks are perceived.
it affects the most profound and sincere options by which the way they live.
this practical relativeism consists of living as if God had not existed, decide as if the poor did not exist, he was created as if the others did not exist, work as if they had not yet received the news.
it should be noted that, even if it appears to embrace strong doctrine and spiritual convictions, it often falls in a lifestyle leading to bridging economic securities, or with human power spaces and glory seeking to achieve in every way, instead of giving his life to others in the mission.
we don' t let the people to tell us the missionary hedge!
le for egoista
when so we need a missionary dynamism that brings salt and light to the world, many layers are fearing that someone invites them to carry out apostolic work, and are seeking to flee from any commitment that can change them from their free time.
today, for example, we have become very difficult to find well- prepared catechists for parishes and persevering in their work for a number of years.
but something similar is happening in the priests, which have become obsolete at their personal time.
this is often due to the fact that many people feel the great need to maintain the spaces of their autonomy, as if the evangelization work was some periculous poison in the response to God' s love to call us for the mission and strengthen us to make fruit.
some resist from finishing until the end of the mission' s fun and remain unfounded in a chose to realize them.
the problem is not always over- activeism, but above all is the activity that is wrongly done, without the right motivations, without a spirituality that spread into every action and makes it a beautiful thing.
here the duties end up to defeat more than properly, and sometimes destroyed.
it would not be tired, but one filled tension, pisants, is not satisfied and, undoubtedly, is not welcomed.
this pastoral window may have a lot of roots.
some fall in because their mind in projects that cannot be carried out and do not know accepting what they can do with tranquillity.
others, because they do not accept the hard change of processes and want everything to fall from heaven.
others, because they link with some successful projects or dreams that have seen themselves vanitously.
others, because they have lost true contact with people, in pastoral who lost the pulse of people, where more were mindful in the organisation of the thing than in the persons with whom they share, so that more temptation of them the 'road map "than the road itself.
others fall in the field, because they don' t know waiting for a finding, they must dominate the life rhythm.
today' s obeyment has pastoral operators to achieve immediate results do not allow them to tolerate how he wasb and reached someone who contradicts them, the sense of bankruptcy, criticism, cross.
this is the greatest threat, "which is the grey pragmaticism of the day - to - day life of the Church, where everything appears to be normal, while in truth the faith is being eaten and end up in nothing." [63] I develop the psychology of the catch, which gradually changes Christians in good memories for museum. "
their heart cut from the reality of around them, from the Church and themselves, live the continuous temptation to be linked to sweet, hopeless, to conceive them to his heart was "the most precious drug of the walls." [64] Those who were called to disseminate light and lead to life, finally they end up to things that bring only darkness and tiredness have been penalty, and to weaken the Apostolic dynamism.
so let me listen: we don' t leave those who hear us the joy of evangelization!
No for sterile pessimism
the joy of the Gospel is what someone and nothing can ever change us (see Jn 16: 22).
our world' s evil - and that of the Church - should never be excuse to reduce our commitment and our encouraged.
we take them as challenges to stamp.
Moreover, the look of faith has the ability to recognise the light that the Holy Spirit always disseminates the darkness, without forgotten that "where the sin, cotrot on the grace" (Rom 5: 20).
our faith is challenged to keep away that wine that water can be changed into it, and to discover the grain growing heart of the bowel.
fifty years after the Vatican Council II, even if we hear us before our time fees and we are far from ingenous optimism, more realism should not mean less trust in the Spirit nor less generosity.
in this sense, we can return to listen to the words of the Blessed John XXIII on that memorable day of 11 October 1962: "Not less offensive to our ear, we will make us the words of some that, although they bought heavily for religion, assess the facts without sufficient objectivity and prudent judgement.
in the current conditions of human society, they do not see anything more than row and worried [...] We believe that we must not be able to agree with these discomfort prophets, who always announce the worst, they don' t seem to win the end of the world.
in the present situation of human events, where humanity seems to come to a new order of affairs, we must see the mysterious plans of Divine Providenza, which occur at every time through human crops, and often there is from what they expect, while with their knowledge they use everything, even the corrupt events of humans, for the benefit of the Church. "[65]
one of the most serious temptations that enjoy the hedge and courage is when we feel heard, a sense that we change us in pessimists with undoubtedly hardened face and their heart cut.
No one can enter to a battle if before you are completely thrown into a triumph.
those who are leaving the first steps without having confidence already lost before half of the battle and are defending his talents.
even if with the knowledge of our bishops that discourage us, we need to remain forward without giving our soul with joy, and remember what the Lord said to St Paul: "Blessed for you my grace; because my power appears in its best where there is weak" (2 Cor 12: 9).
the Christian triumph is always a cross, but a cross that at the same time is a stendard of victory, which we get it hardly ready to combat the attacks of evil.
the bad spirit of the loss he felt the temptation to redeem prior to the time of grain from the gut, a lack of anxious and eccentric trust.
it is clear that in some areas "spiritual desertification, fruit the project of societies that want to build themselves without God or to try to destroy their Christian roots.
"the Christian world is becoming sterile, is drying, such as over- exploited land that finishes desert sand." [66] In some other countries, violent resistance against Christianity to Christians are obliging them to live their faith almost hidden in the same country that they love.
this is another tenant form of desert.
even the family and the workplace can be done that dry environment where we need to maintain faith and seek to disseminate it.
but "we want to start by getting this desert, this empty, so we can rediscover the joy we believe and the vital importance it has for us faith.
in the desert we rediscover the value of what is essential for life; therefore in today' s world we have a large number of signs, which often appear implicitly or negatively, of the thirteen for God, for the final meaning of life.
and in the desert there is a need for people of faith who have their own lives show what is the way towards the promised Land and keep the hope. [67] What is, in those circumstances, we are called to be wearing live water to drink others.
sometimes the deceased is transformed into a heavy cross, but he is propelled on the Cross that the Lord, with a wool side, was given for us as a source of living water.
we don' t let us listen to the hope!
Yes to the new relations created by Jesus Christ
today, when the nets and tools of human communication have made unprecedented developments, we feel the challenge of discovering and transmit "mystic" to live together, to leave, to meet each other, to rely on each other, to be part of this wave some chaotic that, but, it can be transformed into a true experience of fraternity, in a customs of solidarity, in a holy pilgrimage.
in this way, the greatest possibilities of communication change in great possibilities of meeting and solidarity between all.
we had to move in this way, how good it would be, to cure, to get hope!
how much is we worth leaving ourselves to join others!
we are close to ourselves means that the men of mankind, and is the humanity that suffers with every self - law choice we do.
the Christian ideal always inviting us to overcome all suspicion, permanent lack of trust, fear that someone is inviting us privacy, defensive behaviour that today' s world imposes on us.
many try to escape from others to something that is private and comfortable, or to a restricted circle of those most as you, and do not accept the realism of the social dimension of the Gospel.
because, as some want a purely spiritual Christ, without meat and without calib, they also reiterate interpersonal relations that are created only through sophisticated devices, screens and systems that can turn them and understand them from your hands.
on the other hand, the Gospel always invites us to enter at the risk of meeting with the surface of the other, with his physical presence to challenge us, his promises and his achievements, with his joy to be taken in constant physical contact with each other.
the authentic faith in the Son of God made meat can not understand it from our own gift, from belonging to the community, service, reconciliation with the body of others.
the Son of God, in his incarnation, invited us to revolution of sweetness.
isolation, which is another version of the immigrantism, can express itself in false autonomy to leave outside God but that in religious you can find a form of spiritual consumption that meets its obsolete individualism.
return to sacred and spiritual search characterising our epoka are ambiguous phenomena.
but more than ateism, today we have to face the challenge of responding adequately to the thirteen people have God, not to seek to earn him with alien proposals or Jesus Christ without body or without commitment to others.
if in the Church we do not find a spirituality that cure them, stick them with life and peace, and that at the same time they call on them for the joint community and to make missionary fruit, they will end up by proposals that neither do man nor give glory to God.
the genuine forms of popular religion are incarnated, because they are inhibited by the incarnation of Christian faith in a popular culture.
they therefore include a personal relationship, not with vague spiritual energies, but with God, with Jesus Christ, with Mary, with some Saint.
have a body, have surfaces.
they cost to enhancing the potential of relationship and should not be individualistic findings.
in other areas of our societies the estimate towards several different forms of 'spirituality of well- being "without community, to' prosperity theology" without any commitment to brothers, or to subjective experiences which do not face, which are reluctant to a search have been wounded to look only in itself.
an important challenge is to show that the solution has never been found by shaping a personal and committed relationship with God, which at the same time commends with others.
this is happening today when believers are seeking to hide ahead, and when from under escape from one place to another or from work to the other, without creating deep and stable links: "Imaginatio locorum et mutatio multos fefellit." [68] This is a false solution to mark the hearts and sometimes the body.
we need to help them to recognise that the single way is what we learn to meet others with the right attitude, appreciate them and welcome them as our partners on the road, without putting any indoor resistance.
Moreover, it is to learn to discover Jesus in the face of others, in their Jehen, in their achievements.
and we also learn to suffer in a brightness with Jesus from the hearts when they have suffered unfair attacks or gratitude, without promising ever making the choice of fraternity. [69]
the disciples of the Lord are called to live as a community that is salt of the earth and light of the world (see Mt 5: 13 - 16).
they are called to give evidence of evangelization in an ever new manner. [70] I don' t leave the community to hear us!
No for spiritual mondanity
the spiritual monarchity, which is brought after appearance of religious and even love towards the Church, consists of one, instead of the glory of the Lord, seeks human glory and his own wealth.
is the one on which the Lord has given to the Pharisees: "But how can you believe, you will take glory from each other, while nothing does you seek glory coming from God alone?" (Jn 5: 44).
he is a subtle way of "seeking to agree to him and not what Jesus Christ is" (On 2: 21).
it appears under several forms, depending on the type of person and the conditions in which they spread.
as it is linked to the way it appears, it is not always partners from public sins, and in addition it appears correct.
but if this translates into the Church, "leaves too much more disastrous than any other community that is simply moral." [71]
this monarchity grows especially in two ways that are closely linked to each other.
one is the seafarer of Nosecism, faith closed in subjectiveism, where only one is interested from a specific experience or series of reasoning and knowledge that he thinks that he may be honoured or deviated him, but where the subject remains closed in the absence of his own reason and feelings.
the other is the authoritarian and promising Neopelagianism of those who trust only in their own health and feel on others because they observe certain precise norms or because they are faithfully faithful to a certain Catholic style that is the thing of the past.
this is a claim of doctrine or disciplinary certainty that gives width to a narcisist and authoritarian elitarism, where we instead evangelize, we can analyse and classify others, and instead make the grace more achieved, we will strengthen us.
in both cases, neither Jesus Christ nor the others do not really interact us.
they are exhibitions of anthropoocentric imagents.
we cannot imagine that from these deserved forms of Christianity can issue an authentic dynamism of evangelization.
this dark community appears in several answers that are out of the outside appear against each other but all expect that they can dominate the Church' s space. "
in some of us we have been afraid to the liturgy, doctrine and for the joy of the Church, but without interested them that the Gospel will enter into the life of the People of God and in the concrete needs of history.
in this way the life of the Church is converted into an opra piece of museum or in an article located in the hands of the little.
in other, the same spiritual mondanity is taken after the seafarer of social and political achievements, or in a manner - related vanagloria capable of running practical clothing, or in attractiveness to the dynamics of their self - assessment and self -ferential realization.
it can also be seen in several ways of trying to appear, involved in a social life full of journeys, meetings, meals, proceeds.
or lead to managerial functionalism, complete statistics, plans and evaluations, where the most enjoyed not the People of God but rather the Church as an organisation.
in all these cases, it is lacking from the seal of Christ incarnated, hearts and Rxoxt, is closed in groups of élite, it is not really looking for those who are promised nor the great cause for Christ.
there is no longer an evangelical Gospel, but the empty pleasure of personal satisfaction and self - centric.
in this context, you find a land where the vanaglory of those who contend themselves to have some power and prefer to be general of armed wounded than mere soldiers of a small group that continues to fight.
how often we have been created with apostolic expansion plans, mythesis and well- founded, typical of general smell!
we will like our history of a Church, which is glory as much as it is a history of sacrifices, hope, a daily fight, of life consumed in service, of perseverance in hard work, because every work is "sweep of our joints."
instead, we have always lost on "what should be done" - the sin of "what should be done" - as we are spiritual teachers and pastoral experts who give instructions but remain outside.
we lost in imagination without any limits and lose contact with the reality of suffering living the faithful people.
who fell in this monarchity, looks at the high and distance, rejects the prophecacy of brothers, I have chose the askers, hyperrecaemia all the errors of others and is obsolete by what appears out of the outside.
he said he moved to the closed shield of his management and interests and, in this, they will not be learned from his own sins nor is it authentically open to forgiveness.
it is a tremendous corruption that out of the outside seems something good.
this needs to avoid it, and we place the Church in a movement of exit from itself, of a mission whose centre is Jesus Christ, committed to the poor.
God takes us from a Church of the world that is brought under a spiritual or pastoral cover!
this monarchity capable of hurricting we can be able to herself if we take the breath of the Holy Spirit, which will be free to remain united in our ownselves, hidden under a religious appearance battle by God.
we don' t leave the Gospel!
No for the wars of us
how many wars in the same People of God and in the number of communities!
in the areas where we have seen, on the corner of the work, both wars due to hate and richness, even between Christians themselves!
the spiritual community leads Christians to enter war with other Christians hindering them in their exhibition to power, prestigious, pleasure or economic security.
in addition, some do not remain in the Church to then live a spirit of controversy.
instead they feel part of the whole Church, with the rich variety within which they feel of this group or of the other who feel different and special.
the world is understood by wars and violence, or brought from an individualism that has spread and is spreading human beings and warns them against the other to seek their own wealth.
in a number of countries we are re - raising conflicts and olds that we have found to win once forever.
the Christians of all the communities of the world I would like to pray them especially witnesses of a fraternal community that becomes a light that draws to it.
so everyone can yeast the way we take care of each other, as they have become a heart each other and how they join each other: "This recognises everyone that you are my disciples, i. e. if you have love you" (Jn 13: 35).
this is that he asked Jesus to the Father: "We will all be one... fina.... so that the world believes" (Jn 17: 21).
I am careful from the temptation of the ener!
they are all on the same boat and move to the same port!
we pray the grace to be opened with the fruit of each other, which is the fruit of all.
for those who feel brought to ancient flocks it seems difficult to accept that we are praying them to seek forgiveness and reconciliation, because we think we are looking for their pain or reiterating their memory or ideals.
but if they see the testimony of authentically fraternal and reconciled communities, it is always a light that draws to it.
it is therefore very hard when I see how in some Christian communities, and even between consecrated persons, it is allowed to widen for many hate patterns, silver, calunia, malafama, vendetta, rich, desire to propose our idea, what is the price, and to persecutions like them a mercyless jury.
who want to evangelize with this conduct?
we pray the Lord to understand the law of love.
how good is we getting this law!
how good is for us to love each other, despite everything!
Yes, despite all!
Paul' s warning applies to each of us: "Do not leave evil, but win the good evil" (Rom 12: 21).
and again: "We have never done the wealth" (Gal 6: 9).
all we have our sympathies and antipathies, and perhaps propium we are currently angry for someone.
at least say to the Lord: "Lord, I am angry to this, for this.
we pray for him and for him. "
we pray for the person with whom we had to say is a beautiful step towards love, and he is an act of evangelization.
we do it today!
we don' t leave the ideal of fraternal love!
other ecclesial challenges
the Layans are the great majority of the people of God.
they have for their service a tiny minority: the ministers ordered.
today we have grown knowledge about the identity and mission of the laity in the Church.
we have a lot of lakes, even if not enough, with a strong community and great faithfulness towards charity commitment, catechesis, in the celebration of faith.
but the conscience of this laytical responsibility arising from Baptism and Confirmation does not appear in the same way in all places.
in some cases because they have not been formed to assume important responsibilities, in others because in their particular churches did not find the space in which they could express themselves and work, due to over- clericalism that keep them in the side of the important decisions.
even if we are noticeing a greater share of many people in the lakes ministries, this commitment does not reflect itself in the dissemination of Christian values in the social, political and economic world.
it often limits itself to the work of the Church itself, without a real commitment to the application of the Gospel to change society.
the formation of the index and evangelization of professional and intellectual categories represent an important pastoral challenge.
the Church recognises the indispensable role of women in society, with sensibility, intuition and certain particular ability that are usually women than men.
for example, the special attention that women show to around it, expressing itself in particular, even if not exclusive, maternity.
I am pleased to see how many women share pastoral responsibilities with priests, and contribute to helping people, families or groups, and offer a new contribution to theological reflection.
but we still need to further widen spaces for more intense presence in the Church.
because "the female Kingdom is necessary in all expressions of social life; we therefore need to guarantee the presence of women even in the field of work" [72] and in the number of places where important decisions are taken, both within the Church and social structures.
the recognition of the legitimate rights of women, starting from the conviction that men and women have the same dignity, put to the Church deep questions challenging it and that we cannot simply give our eyes.
the priesthood reserved for men, as a sign of the Arab Christ given in the Eucharist, is a matter that is not disectable, but a particular conflict can be motivated if we are over- identified the sacramental power with power.
we must not forget that when we speak about the priesthood power, "this is a matter of office, and not of dignity or holiness." [73] The ministerial priesthood is one of the means of using Jesus to the service of his people, but the high dignity comes from Baptism, which is open to all.
the priest' s attachment to Christ the Ras - which is the main source of grace - does not bring about any exalation that have been placed above all others.
in the Church the offices "do not leave a width for some superiority of one on the other." [74] Indeed, there is a woman, Mary, which is more important than the bishops.
even when the office of the ministerial priesthood is considered 'hierarchical, "we must keep well in front of our eyes that he" ordered totally to the holiness of the members of Christ. "[75] The key and his axle is not the power understood as a domain, but the power to manage the sacrament of the Eucharist; here comes to his authority, which is always in service to the people."
here we have a great challenge for the shepherd and theologists, which can help us understand what this implies for the role that women can play where important decisions are taken, in the various areas of the Church.
Pastoral with young people, as we have been accurately developed, with many dates due to the impact of social changes.
in the existing structures young people often do not find answers to their difficulties, needs, problematics and wounds.
we are adults feel hard to listen to them in the language they understand what it looks like and what they ask, and we learn to discuss them in the language they understand.
for this same reason, educational proposals do not produce the desired fruit.
the spread and growing number of associations and movements made mainly by young people should look at them as a work of the Spirit opening new roads in synony with what they expect and search for a profound spirituality and a more concrete sense of belonging.
but there is still a need for the participation of these groups in the full pastoral work of the Church to be more fully. [76]
even if it is not always easy to close young people, progress has been made in two areas: we recognised that the whole community is called evangelization and educate them, and we were as urgent as they are more protagonists.
we want to recognise that, in the context that we have today a crisis in commitment and links with the community, many are young people offering their solid assistance to the world' s evil and are taking part in various work patterns and volunteering.
some of them participate in the life of the Church, give life to service groups and to various missionary initiatives in their dioces or other dead.
how beautiful it is that young people are "faith travellers," he is leading Jesus on every path, in every square, in every corner of the world!
in many places there is a lack of vocations for priests and consecrated life.
this often knows him to a lack of apostolic day that communities are taken from it, where they do not create enthusiasm and less attractiveness.
where there is life, the hedge, the will that Christ reaches others, he will drive genuine vocabons.
even in those parishes where priests are not so much committed and heat, it is the fraternal life and all encouraged by the community to raise the desire for full consecration to God and evangelization, above all if such a life community requires intensity for vocations and have the courage to propose to its young people a special consecration path.
on the other hand, despite the lack of vocations, we today have a clearer knowledge of the need for a better choice of candidates for priests.
not every motivation is good to continue the seminaries, too much less if these grounds are linked to a lack of affective security, or to search for different forms of power, human glory or economic wealth.
as I have already stressed, here I did not want to offer some full analysis, but I invite communities to continue building on these thoughts and to build them, starting from knowledge of the challenges they directly or closely affect them.
I hope that when doing so, they keep in mind that, every time that in our realities we seek to read the signs of times, it is appropriate to listen to young people and the elderly.
both are the hope of the nations.
the elderly gives you the memory and knowledge of experience, inviting us not to be boloh and repeat the same errors of the past.
young people called us to rebuild and grow in hope, because they themselves bear the new trends of humanity and encourage us for the future, not to remain attached to the nostalgia of structures and habits that are no longer living in today' s world.
the challenges are there to overcome.
we are realistic, but without forgotten joy, courage and full commitment of hope!
we don' t let the people to destroy the missionary power!
evangelization is the duty of the Church.
but this subject of evangelization is too much more than an organic and hierarchical institution, whereas it is foremost a people is not moving to God.
it is undoubtedly a mystery that finds a burden in Trinity, but wearing his historical feelings in a pilgrimous people and evangelizer, which always goes beyond the institutional expression that is ultimately necessary.
I propose that we have a little loss on this way of understanding the Church, which has its basis in the free and free initiative of God.
people for all
the faith that offers us God is a fruit of his mercy.
there is no action that we can do as humans, as good as it is good, that we can close us so high.
God, with his grace only, we will come to us to bind us. [79] He sends his Spirit in our hearts to make us his children, to change us and give us the ability to respond to our love with the same life.
the Church is sent by Jesus Christ as a sacrament of salvation that offers us God. [80] By its work of evangelization, it collaborates as a tool of divine grace that strives undoubtedly, there is from any supervision.
this faith, that God carries out and that the Church proclaimed with joy, is for all, [82] and God opened a way to be bound to each and one of the human beings of every time.
he chose to call them as a people and not as individuals without any link with each other. [83] No one saves alone, i. e. neither as an isolated individual nor by his own power.
God comes to him and keeps in mind the despair of interpersonal relationships that brings about life in a community of human beings.
this people that God chose and called for him is the Church.
Jesus to the Apostles do not tell them to form an exclusive group, a group of élite.
Jesus says: "Go do disciples from all nations" (Mt 28: 19).
St Paul stresses that in the people of God, in the Church, "there is no longer Jewish and less Greek.. because you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Gal 3: 28).
to those who feel distressed by God and the Church, to those who are evily and their hearts by destruction, I would like to say to them: the Lord is also called upon you to participate by his people and do so with great respect and love!
to be a Church means being a People of God, in the light of the great plan of love which the Father has.
this implies that we are the yeast of God' s heart.
it means we announce and deliver God' s salvation in this world, which is often lost, which needs answers that make it the heart, filled it with hope, giving it a new impetus in its journey.
the Church must be the place of mercy given for free, where everyone can feel welcome, loved, bird and encouraged to live according to the good life of the Gospel.
people with many surfaces
this People of God are kept in the people of this land, each with his culture.
the concept of culture is a precious tool to understand the number of different expressions of Christian life present in the People of God.
here we have the lifestyle of a particular society, the specific way in which its members relate themselves, to the other creatures and God.
if we understand it in this way, culture encompasses life as a whole of people. [84] Every people, with the historical range of his life, develops his culture with legitimate autonomy. [85] This knows him to the fact that the human person, "from itself, needs fully social life" [86] and always exists in relation to society, where it actually lives its relationship with the reality of around it.
man has always been found in a culture framework: "The nature and culture are always spending." [87] grace presupposes the culture, and God' s gift is in the culture of the recipient.
in these two Christians of Christianity, many were the people who have received the grace of faith, set it in their daily lives and passed it according to their cultural trends.
when a community welcomes the announcement of the faith, the Holy Spirit gives me its culture with the power of the Gospel to bring about change.
if we understand it properly, cultural diversity is not a threat to the unity of the Church.
he is the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father and the Son, which transforms our hearts and gives us the ability to enter the perfect show with the Holy Trinity, where every thing finds its unity.
he builds the community and harmony of the People of God.
the same Spokesperson is harmony, as is the link of love between the Father and the Son. [93] It is what leads to great wealth and of all kinds of dones and at the same time builds the unity that is never uniform but harmony of many forms that draw up to it.
the evangelization recognises with this richness of all kinds that the Spirit creates in the Church.
we are not doing justice with the logic of incarnation if we think that Christianity is something monocultural and uniform.
even if it is true that some cultures were strictly linked to the broadcasting of the Gospel and the development of Christian thought, the reveled message never identifies one of them because it has trans- cultural content.
therefore, in the evangelization of new cultures and cultures that have not welcomed Christian Christians, it is not necessarily that with the evangelical proposal we must propose a particular cultural form, it is both beautiful and ancient.
the message that we have always proclaimed some cultural library, but sometimes in the Church have played in the vanituous sacrisation of our culture, thus showing more fanaticism than a genuine impetus to evangelization.
all we are missionary disciples
in all flammers, from the first to the end, there works the power of the Spirit that employs and urges what is to evangelization.
the people of God is holy because of this dilute that makes him infallible "in credendo."
this means that when he believes he does not unbalanced, even if he does not find the words to express his faith.
the spirit leads him to truth and leads to salvation. [96] As part of the mystery of love to human beings, God gives all the faithful faith together that faithfulfulness - the fidei sensus - which help to distinguish what is true from God.
the presence of the Spirit gives Christians a certain connectorality with the divine realities and knowledge in which these realities can be used, even if they do not have the right tools to express them with precision.
thanks to the Baptism received, every member of the People of God became a missionary disciple (see Mt 28: 19).
every baptised, whatever its function in the Church and the degree of teaching his faith, is an active subject of evangelization, and it is not appropriate to think in a evangelization scheme carried out by qualified actors where the rest of the people of faith is only receiving their action.
the new evangelization implies a new protagonism of each and one of the bands.
this conviction is transformed into a direct appeal to every Christian, so that no one is left behind his commitment to evangelization, so that, if one has actually experienced God' s love to save him, it does not need too time to prepare himself to announce it, it cannot expect many lessons or long - term instructions to be given.
every Christian is a missionary as much as his meeting with God' s love in Christ Jesus; I do not say more that we "disciples" and "missionaries," but that we are always "disciples - missionaries."
if we are not convinced, let us look at the first disciples, that right after having recognised Jesus' look, went to proclaim him joy: "we have found the Messiah" (Jn 1: 41).
the Samaritana woman has hardly completed its dialogue with Jesus who did not become missionary, and many Samaritans believed in Jesus "on the evidence that they gave them that woman" (John 4: 39).
even St Paul, after his meeting with Jesus Christ, "soon began to proclaim Jesus and says that this is the Son of God" (Acts 9: 20).
and are we awaiting?
undoubtedly, we are all called to grow as evangelizers.
at the same time we strive for better formation, to choose more in the depth of how we love and give more clear evidence of the Gospel.
in this sense, we all want to leave others to evangelize us all times; this, but, does not mean that we remain behind the mission to evangelize, but rather we want to find a way of communication with Jesus corresponding to the situation in which we are found.
it is what is, all of which we are called to offer others a clear witness of the love of the Lord, that there is from our lack of perfection, offer us that he is close to ourselves, his Word, his power, and gives sense to our lives.
in your heart you know that life is not the same who is weak, and therefore what you have discovered, what you help you live and give you hope, what he needs to pass to others.
the fact that we are not perfect should not be excuse; on the contrary, the mission is a constant heavy to not daughter in medoc integrity and to continue to grow.
the witness of the faith that every Christian is called to offer that as St Paul is stated: "I do not say that I am delighted, or that I am a perfect fashion.
but it went forward to know this.. I do all my brothers to achieve what there are Masses "(Fil 3: 12 - 13).
the evangelized power of popular property
likewise, we can look at the various people in which the Gospel was inclined as active collective subjects, evangelization operators.
this is so true because every people creates his culture and is the protagonist of his history.
culture is a dynamic thing, that people will continue to re - create, and every generation will pass on a set of attitudes related to the various existential situations, which has recently faced its challenges need to re - elaborate them.
man "is at the same time a son and father of the culture in which he lives and is inserted." [97] When in some people the Gospel has been neglected, in its cultural transmission process it also undergoes faith in ever new ways; here is the importance of evangelization understood as inculpecting....................................................................................................................................
when every part of the People of God translates into its life God' s gift according to its same Kingdom, it is witnessing the faith that he received and at the same time gives her with new and elocent expressions.
we can say that "the people evangelized continuously himself." [98] I can gain new importance the popular property, which is an authentic expression of the spontaneous missionary action of the People of God.
we are talking about a growing reality, where the Holy Spirit is the protagonist. [99]
in popular property we can see the ways in which faith is welcomed in a particular culture and continue to be transmitted.
there was time when he looked at him with suspicion, but in the decades after the Council became a revaluation item.
he was Paul VI that in his Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii I point an important contribution to this effect.
in the Aparecida document we find a meaning of the richness that the Holy Spirit, with his initiative, disseminates through popular property.
in order to understand this reality, we need to approach it with the look of the Good Youth, which does not seek to judge, but loves.
it is only if we leave this affective connectorality that gives love that we can appreciate the technological life present in the property of Christian peoples, especially in the poor.
imaging in mind the sound faith of those mothers with the bed of their wife, with a rosary crown in their hands, even though they are hardly aware of the articles of the Credu; or that full hope to be numbed in that candy bought at home at a request to Mary for her aid, or in those silence of deep love to a crucifix Christ.
who loves the people of faith and the Saint of God, cannot look at these crops only as a natural search of God.
they are the manifestations of theologal life bought by the action of the Holy Spirit who have been in our hearts (see Romans 5: 5).
in popular property, which is the fruit of the incultured Gospel, there is an hidden power of active evangelization that we cannot take account of it: otherwise we do not recognise the work of the Holy Spirit.
rather, we are called to encourage it and strengthen it so that we can choose more in depth of the inculation process that is a reality that is never terminated.
the expressions of popular property have much to teach us and, for those who have the ability to read them, they are somewhere theological that we should be attending to it, especially when we are thinking in how to make new evangelization.
by one person to another
now that the Church wishes to live a strong missionary renewal, there is a form of prediocation that applies to us all as a daily commitment.
this is to deliver the Gospel to people with whom we share, both our nearest and those who do not know.
it is that informal prediocation that can be done during conversation and is even the one performing missionary when visiting a family.
to be disciples means having a permanent provision to deliver Jesus' love to others, and this occurs spontaneously everywhere, on the road, in the square, at work, during a journey.
in this preamble, always respectful and gentle, the first time consists of a personal dialogue, in which the other person expresses itself and shares its joy, its tasks, its concerns about its belovedness and so many things that are filled with it.
it is only after such conversation that it is possible to present the Word, both with the reading of any extract from the Scripture and whether it tells it, but by keeping in mind always the fundamental announcement: the personal love of God who became man, gave himself for us, and, because he lives, offer us his salvation and friendship.
this announcement shares it with others with a humble attitude and witnesses who are able to learn, aware that the message is so rich and profound that is always above us.
sometimes he expresses itself directly, sometimes through personal evidence, contemplated, or that with the same Spectrum the Holy Spirit to give rise to a concrete circumstance.
if you think it would be prudent and there are the necessary conditions, it is good that this fraternal and missionary meeting will close with a tiny request, linked to the concerns that that person has shown to have.
so, she can feel more clearly that it was truly welcomed and understandable, whose situation has been placed in God, and thus recognizes that God' s Word is indeed speaking to his life.
we must not think that the Gospel' s broadcasting should always be done with predetermined formulae, or with precise words expressing content which cannot differ.
in fact it is announced in so different forms that it is impossible to mean or list them, and in which the People of God, with the unfounded number of management and signs that it has, is a collective subject.
as a consequence, if the Gospel is held in a culture, it will no longer pass through only one person to another.
therefore, in countries where Christianity is in a minority, in addition to encouraging every baptized to broadcast the Gospel, the particular churches should actively promote early trends of inculsion.
Finally, we should seek is that the Gospel, broadcast by categories of culture in which it is delivered, creates a new synthesis with that culture.
although these processes always take in the long term, sometimes fears too much.
if we leave the doubts and fears enjoy our courage, it can happen that, instead of being creative, we simply remain comfortable we without bringing any progress and, in this case, we are not participating in our cooperation in history processes, but we remain just spectators of a Church that is pageable.
the Holy Spirit also gives me with a number of chargers to the whole Church that evangelizes.
these are ions that the Church renews it and build it. [108] I have a closed heritage, given to some group to keep for it; but here we are rather gifts of the Spirit blessed in the body of the Church, which is attracted to the heart that is Christ, may then with evangelized power be addressed to different channels.
a clear sign of the authenticity of a cartel is its ecclesity, its ability to integrate itself in harmony with the life of the Holy People of God for the benefit of all.
when the Spirit raises something new that is authentic, it does not enter any shadow on other spiritualities andoni to affirms itself.
more with a carcassy turned her to the heart of the Gospel, her work will be ecclesial.
even if this cost, it is in the communion that a carma makes fruit authentically and mysterious.
if you live this challenge, the Church can be a model for peace in the world.
the differences that we see between people and communities sometimes deserves us, but the Holy Spirit, which raises this diversity, from all you may draw something good and change it into a dynamism of evangelization that works by attracting it.
diversity should always be combined with the help of the Holy Spirit; only He can stimulate diversity, plurality, multiplicity and, at the same time, carry out unity.
on the other hand, when we are seeking diversity and close to our particular characteristics, in our exclusiveness, we create the silver and, on the other hand, when we are to try to build unity with our human calculations, we have ended to propose monolytic uniformity.
this does not help the Church' s mission.
culture, thought and education
broadcasting to culture also implies announcement to professional, scientific and academic cultures.
here we have the meeting between faith, reason and sciences, aiming at developing a new discourse on the credibility, original apologic [109] which helps create the right environment in which the Gospel is heard by everyone.
where certain categories of reason and science are employed in the broadcasting of the message, those same categories become an evangelization tool; this is the water changed into wine.
they are those who, when we are operated, not only be understood, but become a tool of the Spirit to illuminate and renew the world.
I ask theologists to perform this service as part of the Church' s faithful mission.
but to do so, they must keep in their heart that the Church and theology exist for evangelization and do not contact themselves with theology around the table.
universities are a pre - elected place in which we can think and develop this evangelization commitment in an interdisciplinary and integral manner.
Catholic schools, who always seek to compare the educational mission with the explicit broadcasting of the Gospel, are making a truly valid contribution to the evangelization of culture, even in the countries and cities where the hostile situation has arisen to employ our creativity in order to find appropriate roads. [111]
homily
we now look at preaching in the framework of the liturgy, which requires a serious assessment on the part of the shepherd.
it is particularly lacking, and even with certain meticosity, on homily and preparedness for it, as many are that we have taken attention to this important ministry and we cannot take our ears.
homily is the measure by which the Youth can take into account as close as possible and how ability to enter into a meeting with its people.
in fact, we know that faith gives it great importance; and they are, like the same ministers ordered, often suffer, first to hear and others to preach.
this is a heart of the heart.
the homily can be truly a strong experience and a foundation of the Spirit, a meeting in partnership with the Word, a constant source of renewal and maturity.
we renew our trust in prediocation, which is based on the conviction that God is that through the preacher wishes to reach others and that through the word of man he reveals his strongness.
St Paul strongly speaks of the need for prediocation, because the Lord itself wanted to reach others even with our word (see Romans 10: 14 - 17).
with the word the Lord wins the people.
they come from each side to hear him speaking (see Mk 1: 45).
they had to remain buried and "drink" his learning (see Mk 6: 2).
they feel to speak like one who has the power (see Mk 1: 27).
with the words the Apostles, which he had called them "to remain with him and to send them to" (Mk 3: 14), we get all nations within the Church (see Mk 16: 1520).
the liturgical framework
homily builds on that dialogue which is already open between the Lord and his people.
those who praise, the first must understand the heart of his community to seek where he is a life and encouraged the desire for God, and even where this love dialogue could have been fgated or could not have fruit.
homily cannot be an entertainment spectacle, does not comply with the logic of media resources, but it is necessary to encourage and understand the whole celebration.
it is genre for it, we are neither talking about a prediocation within the framework of a liturgical celebration; it must therefore be short and avoid itself being seen as a conference or lessons.
the preacher may be able to keep the people attending for a full hour, but then his word ends to become more important than the celebration of faith.
if the omelijah is overloaded, damages two features of the liturgical celebration: harmony between its parties and its rhythm.
when the prediocation is made within a liturgical framework, it is part of the offer that gives the Father and mediation of grace that Christ bapes us through the celebration.
this same framework calls for the prediocation to the gaven, and also to the preacher, to a community with Christ in the Eucharist that brings about a change in life.
this requires that the word of the preacher does not take over space, so that the Lord will devive more than the minister.
conversation of a mother
let us know that the people of God, with the Spirit that always works in it, is constantly evangelization himself.
what does this conviction imply for the preacher?
we remind us that the Church is a mother and the people pray as a mother who spoke to her son, and knows that her son has trust that all who are learning to be for his wealth, because he knows that he is loved.
Moreover, the mother knows all that God has rented in her son, listen to what is his concern and learn from it.
the spirit of love that resigns into a family illumines both the mother and her son in their dialogues, where there is what one teaches and what learns, correct and appreciates good things; it also takes place in the homily.
the spirit, which prolongs the writing of the Gospel and works in the People of God, we also replied about how we should listen to the faith of the people and how we must produce in each Eucharist.
the Christian priet, therefore, finds in the heart of the culture of the people of living water, how much to know what it should say, and how much to find the right way to say.
as we all take care of someone who has learned in our fathers, so also in faith, we take fun with our food with the "culture of our fathers," with our mother tongue (see 2 Mak 7: 2127), and the heart is ready to hear too much more.
this language is like cooking melody, breath, power, encouraged.
this ecclesial framework within which the Lord' s dialogue is developed with its people every preacher must seek and cultivate it by being close to people, use a gentle tone in the voice, sweeten in the style of his phrases, and joy in its management.
even when the homily sometimes appears to be planted, if this mother' s mother is felt, always until it leaves fruit, the same as the advice of a mother who sometimes spends us over time leave fruit in the heart of the children.
I am surprising the resources that the Lord used in dialogues with his people, to show his mystery to all, and thus demanding him to common people.
I believe that the secret is hidden after that look of Jesus to his people, there are from his bishops and falls: "No, little herd, swallow nothing, because Father has helped you give you the kingdom!" (Lk 12: 32); Jesus with this spirit persuade.
filled with the joy of the Spirit, blesses the Father who drew to him the tiny: "pray, Father, the Lord heard and land, because you have gone them to the wisdom and dehen and gave them to the tiny" (Lk 10: 21).
the Lord really right to speak with his people and the preacher must seek a way to help them feel this fun.
words that encourage heart
the dialogue is too much more than delivering truth.
it is recognised by the fun to speak and from the true wealth that goes through the words between those who love each other.
it is good that it does not consist of objects, but in the same persons that in the dialogue are given one to the other.
the purely moralist prediocation or seeking to be induced, and even the change in the lesson of executions, very limit this communication between the hearts created in the homily and must have a almost sacramental characteristic: "The faith comes from the hearing, and the hearing from the broadcasting of the word of Christ" (Romans 10: 17).
in the homily, with the truth joins the beauty and good.
here we do not have abstract truths or cold sylloie, because to drive the good livelihood of faith, we must also be served with the beauty of the images that he used the Lord.
as that of Mary, the memory of the faithful people needs to remain expressed by the crowds of God.
he said, open to live the hope of my life and love that he has received in the broadcasting, feels that every word of the Scripture is a gift before he is required.
the challenge of an incultorated priet is in transmitting the synthesis of the Gospel' s message, and not separate ideas or values.
where there is your synthesis, there is also your heart.
the difference between a light on the synthesis or turn light on separate ideas from each other is the same as that between a stretched heart and a heart encouraged.
the preacher has the very beautiful and difficult mission to bring together the hearts that are loved between them: that of the Lord and those of his people.
the dialogue between God and his people more boosted the pact of them and strengthens the link of love.
at the time of homily, the hearts of believers stay in the skins and leave him to speak.
the Lord and his people speak directly with each other in an elephly, without the need for intermediaries.
however, in the homily, they want someone else to make it an instrument and expresses their feelings, so that then each and one can choose how to continue conversation.
the word is essentially mediator and not only calls for both of them to deviate but even a preacher presenting it as what is, convinced that "we are" Jesus the Lord are proclaiming, and not ourselves; we are not except your servants because of Jesus Christ "(2 Cor 4: 5).
in order to speak from the heart, we need to keep it not only always encouraged, but also surrounded by the Revelation and the path that God' s Word ended in the heart of the Church and of our faithful people during the history range.
the Christian identity, which is that of the Baptish Baptism that the Father gave birth since we were still small, embrace us, such as battle children - and special children in Mary -, for other beds, that of the Father filled mercy inviting in glory.
the hard but beautiful work of those who preach the Gospel is what we help our people feel that they are between these two beds.
III.
preparation for prediocation
preparation for prediocation is a so important task that we should devote it a longer time of study, prayer, reflection and pastoral creativity.
with many love I would like here to propose a journey that one should do in preparation for homily.
they are indications that for some knowing obviously, but I feel that we should suggest them to remind in the need to devote a precious time for this ministry.
some parish priests often insist that this is not possible due to so many tasks they want to carry out; however, we ask that every week one devote personal and community time rather long for this work, even if it would have to give less time to other important commitments.
trust in the Holy Spirit working in prediocation is not passive, but active and creative.
we ask us to offer us as a tool (see Romans 12: 1), with all our skills, so that they can be used by God.
a preacher who does not prepare himself as follows not "spiritual," he is disonest and irresponsible in relation to the dones received.
truth worship
the first step, after we call us to the Holy Spirit, he is to pay attention to the Biblical text, which should be the foundation of any prediocation.
in order to interpret a Biblical test it is necessary to find, remove all anxiety and give from our time, interest and hydrated dedication.
we need to be set aside in the side every trouble we are encouraging us to enter into another environment of serena attention.
it does not cost anything to seek in a Bibliku test rapid, light or immediate results.
therefore, preparation for prediocation calls for love.
we devote from our time and without a dough only to those things or loving persons; and here we are talking about love towards God who wanted to speak with us.
if we leave this love, we come to find all the time you need, with the attitude of the disciples: "Talking, Lord, because your servant is listening" (1 Sam 3: 9).
we have to be sure that we are understand how well the sense of the words we are reading.
I would like to press on a point that seems obvious but that we do not always keep it enough before our eyes: the Bibliku test that we are worst has an elephant or thirteen thousand years, his language is very different from what we use today.
even if we believe that the words are understanding it, because it is converted into our language, this does not mean that we are correctly understanding what the sacred author understands.
the various tools offered by the literary analysis are known: we will look at the words reiterated or highlighted, take into account the structure and dynamism of a particular text, take into account what is the role of the persons, and so on.
but our goal is not to understand all the small details of the text, because the most important is to understand which is the main message, what it gives a building and unity to the text.
if the preacher does not make this effort, it may happen that neither its prediocation has unity and order; his speech will be only a set of ideas without articulation whereby they fail to drive others.
the central message is what the author wanted to pass, and this means that not only we want to understand the idea, but even recognise the effect that the author wanted to produce.
if a text has been written to mislead, it should not be used to correct errors; if you have been written to import, it should not be used to teach; if you have written to teach something about God, it should not be used to explain several theological ideas; if you have been written to drive to praise or missionary work, we do not use it to give the latest news.
undoubtedly, to understand well the meaning of the central message of some text, it is necessary to adhere to the teaching of the whole Bible, how the Church passes.
this is an important principle of the Biblical interpretation, bearing in mind that the Holy Spirit does not only open part of the Bible, but the Bible as a whole, and that in some particular issues the people have grown in his knowledge of God' s will in the light of the experience passed by it.
in this way we avoid misinterrupted or partial interpretations, which contradict other learning of the same Holy Skritture.
but this does not mean that we will weaken the propium and specific accent of the text on which we will proclaim.
one of the prediocation defects and ineffective is what we do not have the ability to pass to people the same power to carry the text announced.
personalisation of the Word
we do not want to forget that "in particular, the holiness of the Minister, great or small, indeed influences the announcement of the Word." [116] How to support St Paul, "we proclaim the Gospel.. and seek to work not to humans but to God who bear our hearts" (1 Tess 2: 4).
if in our heart there is a truly encouraging this desire to hear we first the Word we must proclaim, this in any way or otherwise will pass to the People of God: "From the heart mile speaks the mouth" (Mt 12: 34).
Sunday' s reading remains in his beauty in the heart of the people, if the first of all is so long in the heart of the Love.
Jesus would like to see those who attend him of a boss of God' s Word, executives with others, but that then do not illuminate himself: "They bind large and heavy killings and give them to others, while they themselves less with one will not have to train them" (Mt 23: 4).
the Apostle Jacbu exerts: "Himens, no more than you teachers, because we know that we are to learn we are judged more carefully" (Jak 3: 1).
anyone who wants to preach, the first must be ready to leave the Word greet and keep it in his concrete life.
this has great pastoral importance.
even at our time the people prefer to hear from witnesses: "They have the thread of authenticity [...] are calling on those who may evangelize, to give him to God who are supposed to know and who they often go to have as if you are seeing the Invisible." [118]
we are not expected to be blessed in everything, but rather that we are always in a process in which we continue to grow, living the strong desire to stay forward on the path of the Gospel, and let us not pass arms.
it is essential that the preacher be sure that God loves, that Jesus Christ loved him, who love always has the last word.
before beauty so great, one often feels that with his life does not give him full glory and sincerely wishes to respond better to so high love.
but if you don' t stop to listen to the Word genuinely open, if you don' t leave to touch his life, challenge him, add, train from his place, if you don' t devote the time for prayer with the Word, then it would be a false, clear and clear prophet empty.
what is, if he leaves the knowledge of his poverty and the desire to engage more, can always lead Jesus Christ, as Peter states: "Silver and gold must not be; but what I will give him" (Acts 3: 6).
the Lord must be read with us as a live, free and creative essri, leaving his Word to hear their hearts before they pass it to others; his message must first actually pass through the preacher, but not only by a hono- reason, but by taking possession of all his essents.
the Holy Spirit, which opened the Word, is what "as was at the beginning of the Church, works in any evangelizer that leaves himself to be forgotten and led by him; puts on his words that he was not able to find." [119]
spiritual reading
there is a concrete way to listen to what the Lord wants to tell us in his Word and how we leave his Spirit to change us.
it is what we call it "lectio divine."
it consists of reading the Word of God at the time of prayer so that we can turn and renew it.
this reading of the Bible in a climate of prayer not understood by the study that the preacher makes to find what is the core message of the text; on the contrary, there must be to leave, so that it can discover that same message what is saying to his life.
the spiritual reading of a particular text shall be leaves somewhat from its literal meaning.
otherwise we easily seem to put on hold the text what we agree to us, what we need to confirm our decisions, what we stand for our mental schemes.
if we do so, we will certainly not perhaps be forgotten with a holy thing for our personal advantage and pass this same confusion to the People of God.
we must never forget that sometimes "not amazing because Satan itself changes in a light angel" (2 Cor 11: 14).
in the presence of God, during a calm reading of the text, it is good to ask us ourselves: "Lord, what is you saying to me this text?
what do you want to change in my life with this message?
what is you cure in this silk?
why does this affect you?, "or:" What do you like, what is you to imagine in this Word?
what happens in it?
why do I happen? "
when we seek to listen to the Lord is normal that we have temptations.
one of them is simply when I feel united and united, and we are close to ourselves; another very common temptation is to start thinking in what the text is saying to others, to avoid applying it to our own lives.
it also happens to seek a excuse whereby the specific text message is approached.
we often think that God is calling for us too great decision, that we are no longer in a state we can take.
this leads many persuties to lose the joy of the meeting with the Word, but this because they will be forgotten that no one is as painted as God the Father, who nobody knows and expects as much as he knows He.
he always invites us to take another step, but does not seek a full answer from us if we have not yet done all the journey that makes it possible.
just like to look with sincerity towards our lives and present it without distortions, that we would be willing to continue to grow, and to pray what we have so far not yet been able to arrive for it.
listen to the people
the preacher should also listen to the people, to discover what the faith needs to hear him says.
a preacher is what you call the Word and also contemplates the people.
this concern is not due to an appropriate or diplomatic attitude, but is deeply religious and pastoral.
it is in fact "spiritual sensibility to read God' s message in what happens" [121] and this is much more than simply find something interesting to say.
what we are seeking to discover is "what we have to say to us or that circumstance." [122] Therefore, the preparation for prediocation is transformed into an evangelical discernment exercise, where one seeks to recognise - in the light of the Spirit - that 'call' that God is mentioned in the same historical situation.
in such a situation, and through which God calls on believers. "[123]
in this search it is possible to simply resort to some human experience which we often have passed from it, such as the joy of a new meeting, delusions, fear of solitude, mercy for others suffering, doubts before the future, concerns for a dear person, and others; but we need to also grow in our sensibility to recognise what is actually affecting their lives.
we remember that there is never a need to respond to questions that nobody does; nor is it appropriate to offer facts of current chronaka to drive interest: for this already television programmes.
however, we can leave a history to enable the Word to have a better effect in its invitation to conversion, adoration, to concrete fraternity and service behaviour, and others, sometimes some people take fun in the priet listen to comments on reality, but it is not this to drive them and challenge them personally.
pedagogic tool
some think they are good preachers because they know what they should say, but neglect how, the concrete way to develop their prediocation.
do not leave when others do not listen to them or appreciate them, but perhaps they do not have to spread the right way to present the message.
we keep in mind that "the content of evangelization is important; this should not lead to the importance of the methods and means." [124] But we think what method we have to use in our prediocation, we are moving with a profound spiritual attitude.
it means responding to God' s love, I encourage with all our skills and creativity to the mission that He is knows us in our hands; but he is also an exercise of love towards the proximity, because we do not offer others something of poor quality.
for example, in the Bible we find the advice to prepare well its prediocation to ensure that it is done with due regard: "Short talk, and very well in a few words" (Sir 32: 8).
to give an example, we remember in some practical tools that can give us our prediocation and make it more attractive.
one of the efforts we need to do is that in our prediocation we learn images, that is to say with images.
sometimes we use examples to make it more understandable, but those examples often appeal only to the reasoning of the mind; images, but should help appreciate and welcomes the message we need to be counted.
it' s a nice to attract the eye helps to listen to family, close, possible, life - related.
a good image can lead to what would be to hinder the message we want to be felt, again raise desire and raise the will in the direction of the Gospel.
good homily, as he said to me my old teacher, should contain "idea, sentiment, image."
Paul VI has already written that the faith "expect much of this broadcast and take great profit from it as simple, clear, direct, adapted to them." [125] simplicity relates to the language used.
it must be a language that hearers can understand, so that we do not risk speaking in the empty.
it is often true that preachers are read in words that they learned throughout their studies and in particular environments, but that they do not belong to the common language of the people who are choking them.
there are words which are the right of theology or catechesis, the meaning of which is not understood by most Christians.
the greatest risk for a preacher is to read in his language and considers that all others are using it and understand it from the first.
if we want to adapt ourselves to the language of others so that we can arrive with the Word, we need to listen very first, we need to share in people' s lives and from our right to be attending to them.
simplicity and clarity are two different things from each other.
the language can be very simple, but the priet knows to be little clear.
you may not be understood because it does not contain an order, is lacking logic, or because it treats many subjects at the same time.
therefore another necessary work is to make a way that the prediocation contains a thematic unit, a clear order and a link between judgment and others, so that people can easily follow the preacher and understand the logic of what he says.
another characteristic is the positive language.
we should not say what should not be done, but rather what we can do better.
in any case, if we are visiting our subpherd to something negative, we should always seek to show even positive and attractive value, not to stand on therid ,ergir, criticism or shooters.
Moreover, a positive prediocation always offers hope, a torent towards the future, we don' t leave the negactivity mirror.
how good it is that priests, the diacons and the summer sometimes gathering to together find the right tool to make their prediocation more attractive!
the missionary mandate of the Lord contains the call to stamp in faith: "for them to protect all that I have ordered you" (Mt 28: 20).
it is clear that the first announcement should lead to a path of formation and maturing.
evangelization also seeks to grow, and this implies that we take much seriously to every person and the plan that the Lord has for it.
every man always needs Christ, and evangelization should not leave any person to contact himself with little, but from her heart says: "I live, but not more I am, but live in Christ" (Gal 2: 20).
we are not correct if this call to stamp it exclusively or above all as a doctrine formation.
she is calling for us "to look" what the Lord uriena, in response to his love, where, together with all the realities, inspires that new commandment that is the first, the greatest one, the most auxilian as disciples: "This is my commandment: who love each other as I have announced you" (Jn 15: 12).
it is clear that when the authors of the new will have to collect the Christian moral message in a final synthesis, in what is the most essential, we put us to us the absolute need for love towards the proximity: "Every who loves to protect the remainder of the Law.. love is the media of Law" (Rom 13: 8,10).
"if you carefully look at the best law, according to the Scripture: 'You love your eyes like yourself," you will be doing well "(Jak 2: 8).
"all the law is collected in one law: 'You love your eyes like yourself" (Gal 5: 14).
Paul to his communities propose a journey in which they grow in love: "Shoulder the Lord unto you and shaping you with love for each other and to everyone" (1 Thess 3: 12).
on the other hand, the donor always comes before this journey of response and maturing, as the first is that other call of the Lord: "they have kept them on behalf of..." (Mt 28: 19).
the adoption of a child that the Father gives us free and the initiative of the gift of his grace (see Efes 2: 8 - 9; 1 Cor 4: 7) is the condition for this permanent holy to love and glory God.
it means that we leave Christ to change us for a growing life "according to the Spirit" (Rom 8: 5).
kerigmar and mistagoic catechesis
education and catechesis are at the service of this maturity process.
we should help us various texts of the Magisty and subsidies for catechesis that offered us both the Holy See and a number of Episcopal Conferences.
seasons in mind the Apostolic Exhortation Catechesi tradendæ (1979), the general directory for catechesis (1997), and other documents whose content does not have to be indemnity here.
I would like to stop only on some points I think it is appropriate to talk about them.
we have discovered that even in catechesis, the first announcement, or "Kerygma," has a fundamental role, which should be at the heart of the work of evangelization and of any thought of renewal in the Church.
the Kerygma is Trinitary.
it is the fire of the Spirit that we are given us under the form of ourselves and imagine with faith in Jesus Christ, with his death and resurrection shows us and disseminate us the unfounded mercy of the Father.
on hold the catechist always returning the elic of the first announcement: "Jesus Christ loves you, of his life to judge, and now he is a living and close to your day, to make you, to seize you, to release you."
when I say that this announcement is "first," this does not mean that it is at the beginning and then after we forgotten it or instead put other contents that are better than it.
it is the first in qualitative sense, because it is the main announcement, what we always have to return to it to listen to it in its various trends and that we always have to turn to it to proclaim it in catechesis in a blade or other, at all stages and moments. [126] Therefore even "priest, such as the Church, should always recognise the need to evangelized." [127]
we do not want to think that in catechesis the Kerygma should be left to the side to make a width for a formation that is supposed to be more "solid."
there is no more solid, profound, sure, consistent and knowledge of this announcement.
the Christian formation is the deepening of the Kerygma which continues to grow increasingly and better, never to survive the commitment of catechesis, and to help us better understand the meaning of any other theme which develops in catechesis.
it is the announcement that it responds to the thirteen that there is in every human heart to what remains forever.
the centrality of the Kerygma calls for us to be confused on some features of the announcement that today we need them everywhere: expressing God' s faithful love that comes before any moral and religious obligation, which does not impose truth but seeks freedom, which is marked by joy, encouraged, life, and a sense of harmonious media that does not want prediication to a few doctrines sometimes more philosophical than evangelical.
this calls for the evangelizer a certain provision of the heart in which it can better help hearers to welcome the message: it would be close to people, open to dialogue, patience, and always ready to welcome love and not condemn.
another catechesis feature, which has developed in the last decades, is that of the mistagoic inhalation, [128] which essentially means two things: the need for progressive experience of formation involving the whole community and a renewed valorisation of the liturgical signs of Christian aviation.
many manuals and programming have not yet given sufficient consideration of the need for a mistagoical renewal, which may take several trends in agreement with the discernment of each community who have launched.
the catechesis meeting is the announcement of the Word and turns it, but it always needs an appropriate environment, motivation to attract the eye, the use of elocent symbols, income in a broad process in which all the dimensions of the person continue to develop and grow, in a community journey of hearing and answer.
it is a good thing that every catechist shows special attention to "a way of beauty" (via pulchritudinis). [129] I proclaim Christ means showing that it believes inH and goes behind it is not just a proper and appropriate thing, but also beautiful, which has the ability to complete life with completely new beauty and with a strong hena, even heart trib.
in this perspective, all the expressions of true beauty can look at them as a way that helps us meet the Lord Jesus.
we do not speak above that we encourage aesthetic relativeism, [130] that can admit the inseparable link between truth, beauty and beauty, but to recover that respect towards beauty through which we can meet the heart of man and do to hope in the truth and the tighs of Irxoxt.
if, as St Augustine affirms, we are nothing to love except what is beautiful, [131] the Son made man, a revelation of long - term beauty, he is who love above all, and we will come to him with love links.
it is therefore necessary for formation in via pulchritudinis to be part of the transmission of faith.
as regards the moral proposal of catechesis, which invites us to grow in faith towards the lifestyle of the Gospel, it is appropriate to look at the desired wealth, the proposal for life, maturity, realisation, wastage work, and in the light of this, others understand why we disseminate the evil that can hinder this life.
rather than like experts in apocalytic diasons or dark judgements who take fun to rely on any danger or deviation, we better look at us as a biennial announcement of high proposals, silver of the thighs and beauty that live in a faithful life towards the Gospel.
personal accompanying in the processes by which we stamp
in a civility brought at the bottom of her heart by anonymate and, at the same time, fixed on the details of the life of others, unfortunately marid with obsolete curiosity, the Church needs a close look to contemple, drive and stop before the other every time necessary.
in this way the ministers ordered and other pastoral operators may disseminate the perfume of the presence of Jesus that is always close to our own and his personal look.
the Church needs to convene its members - priests, religious and laity - with this "arts of accompany," so that all learn to be sold to the Holy Land of the other person (see Ex 3: 5).
we need our journey to give it a strong rhythm that spends it close to others, with a full look of respect and mercy but that at the same time it has the ability to cure, release and encourage maturity in Christian life.
even if this is heard obvious, spiritual accompany should always lead to God, in which only we can get to our full freedom.
some think they are free when moving away from God, without writing that so they have remained an orphan exhisttion, without anyone whoever who is to be thrown, without house to whom they can always return.
they stop living on pilgrims and change in people who grow here and there, who turn always to themselves without arriving elsewhere.
the accompanying leaves the unlike if a species of therapy is carried out which seeks the closure of people in their management and no pilgrimage with Christ to the Father.
more than ever we need men and women who, with the experience they have in the accompanying, show us the way we have to share, where they inspire prudence, the ability to understand others, the art of waiting, the sweetness to leave the Spirit works fine, to protect all the needs we trusted in our hands by theup to try to seize herd.
we need to train in the arts of hearing, which is rather than mere listening to your ears.
first, in communication with others, it is the heart' s ability to close others, without which there is no real spiritual meeting.
the hearing helps us to recognise what is the rightest or word to protect us from the transitional situation of spectators.
it is only if we leave this hearing, which shows respect and can understand the situation of others, we can find streets for true maturity, that we can rebuild in the desire of Christian ideal, the desire to respond fully to God' s love and the desire to develop best what God has rented in our life.
but this is always with the finding of who knows what St Tumas teaches: one can have grace and love, but does not properly operate any of the virtues "due to some contrary inclinations" [133] persisting in it.
in other words, the organic unity of the virtues exists always and necessarily "in habit," although outdoor conditions can make it difficult to carry out those virtuous habits.
here the need for a 'pedagogogy leading to people, a step after the other, to make the mystery fully. "[134] To reach a maturity point, i. e. to enable people to take truly free and responsible decisions, necessarily we need to give time and move with great finding.
as the Beat Peter Favre said: "The time is God' s messages."
who goes in this accompanying knows that the situation of every subject to God and before the life of his grace is mystery that from outside someone can understand fully.
the Gospel proposes us to guide and help a growing person by first recognising the objective of its crops (see Mt 18: 15), but without having passed judgments on its responsibility and guilt (see Mt 7: 1; Lk 6: 37).
in any case, a good accompanied does not proceed to frustration or fear.
he always calls on the accompanying person to seek healing, re - gestation, embrace the cross, leave everything, and come again to proclaim the Gospel.
our personal experience of accompanying and healing, if we manage to grow with full sincerity our life before those who are acceding to us, teach us how to print and understand others and give us the ability to find ways of re - driving trust, openness and desire to grow.
the authentic spiritual accompany always starts and goes forward within a service framework to the evangelization mission.
Paul' s relationship with Timothy and Titu is an example of this accompany and this formation during the apostolic action.
he knows them the mission to stop in each city to "distribute everything by order" (see Tit 1: 5; see 1 Tim 1: 3 - 5), give them some criteria to lead them in personal life and pastoral action.
it is clear that all this differs from all kinds of intimidist, self - liberalisation in isolation.
missionary disciples accompany missionary disciples.
around God' s Word
not only homily should drink from God' s Word.
all evangelization is based on it, on the hearing, meditation, livelihoods, celebration and witnesses thereof.
the Holy Scripture is a source of evangelization.
therefore, we need to continuously foster in the Word hearing.
the Church cannot evangelize if it is not continuously evangelized.
it is essential that God' s Word "become increasingly the core of all the work of the Church." [135] The Word of God heard and celebrated, above all in the Eucharist, hopeful and undoubtedly born to Christians and to be able to give authentic testimony of the Gospel in everyday life.
until now, it was completely suited that contrast worked between Word and Sacrament.
the word announced, life and effective, is prepared to receive the Sacrament, and in the Sacrament this Word reaches its highest effectiveness.
evangelization means making God' s Kingdom present in the world.
it is clear that the Kerygma has social content: at the same heart of the Gospel there is community life and the commitment to others.
the content of the first announcement immediately leaves a moral repercussion whose core is charity.
statement of faith and social commitment
if we proclaim a Father who loves undoubtedly each and one of the human beings, this calls for us to discover that "in this way he is already giving him dignity to remain forever." [141] I stated that the Son of God took the meat of our body of human beings means that every man has been raised for the same heart of God.
if we proclaim that Jesus wrote his blood for us, it keeps us from getting the lowest doubt about the unfounded love that raises every man.
the same mystery of the Trinity reminds us that we have been created in the image of the divine community, and therefore we cannot realize our soul nor save alone.
at the heart of the Gospel we recognise the close link between evangelization and human promotion, which must necessarily express itself and develop in all the work of evangelization.
the acceptance of the first announcement, which invites us to let God loves us and love it with the same love that He gives us, is raised in the life of the person and in its own crops the first fundamental response: you want, seek and have for her heart the wealth of others.
this link that does not leave between the meeting of the announcement of faith and effective love between brothers is expressed in some texts of the Scripture that we are well taken into account and imitate carefully to understand all their consequences.
we are talking about a message that often read it, you have been sheltered almost mechanically, but without ensuring that we are leaving a true effect on our lives and our communities.
what danger and damage is done when we read things, and so we have to lose the sense of reply, happiness, the desire to live the Gospel of the fraternity and justice!
God' s word teaches us that in our brother there is for each of us the permanent prolungation of incarnation: "I have done with one of the smallest among these brothers, I made him promised" (Mt 25: 40).
what we do with others has a descendant dimension: "With the same measure you measure you, are measured to you" (Mt 7: 2); and he is a response to mercy that God has shown us: "his brother, such as Father.
do not judge, and will not be judged; condemn, and not be condemned; brothers, and find the forgiveness; give him, and be given to you [...] With the same measure as you measure you to you "(Lk 6: 36 - 38).
what these texts express is the absolute priority of the "exit from us to our brothers" as one of the two main commandments on which each moral norma is based and as the most clear sign for our discernment on the journey in which we are spiritually stamped in response to God' s grant as a whole.
also "charity service is a constituent dimension of the Church' s mission and an expression of its essence that cannot be returned to it." [144] As the Church from its nature is missionary, so that this nature cannot leave the effective charity with the proximity, mercy capable of understanding, assisting and promoting. "
the kingdom called us
from the reading of the Scripture it is clear that the Gospel proposal does not consist solely of a personal relationship with God.
nor our answer of love we should not understand it as a simple set of small personal management with some individuals in need, which can take the braber of "charity à la carte," a series of crops with a view only to restoring our conscience.
the proposal is God' s Kingdom (Lk 4: 43); here I am talking about love towards God who resigns in the world.
according to how many He rests among us, social life becomes a space of fraternity, justice, peace, dignity for all.
therefore, both the announcement and the Christian experience aim to drive social consequences.
we seek his Kingdom: "I have spread the first kingdom and justice of God, and all this will be given to you" (Mt 6: 33).
Jesus' plan is to stop the Kingdom of Father; He therefore calls on his disciples: "Wandru and said that the kingdom of heaven came" (Mt 10: 7).
the mandate is: "Go throughout the world, proclaim the Gospel to all creation" (Mk 16: 15), because "all the creatures are awaiting us the revelation of God' s children" (Rom 8: 19).
all creation also means all aspects of the human nature, so that "the Red News broadcasting mission of Jesus Christ has a universal destination.
its love mandate encompasses all dimensions of existence, all humans, all environments where people live and all nations live.
nothing of all that is human can be foreign to him. "[147] The hope of a true Christian hope, looking for the escatiological kingdom, always creates history.
Church learning on social issues
the Church' s learning on our time situations is subject to greater or new developments and could be a discussion object, but we cannot avoid concrete - without reiterating that we can enter many meetings - so that the major social principles do not remain just general indications that do not move anything.
we need to understand which they are their practical consequences to "allow an effective effect even on the complex situations of our time." [148] the shepherd, while welcoming the contribution they make in this area the various sciences, have the right to express their views on all that affect people' s lives, neither evangelizer is bound by the duty to promote fully all human beings.
it cannot be said that religion should limit itself to the private framework and that there is only to prepare the soul for our parents.
we know that God would like the joy of his children even on this ground, even if they are called for the world of eternal life, because He has left everything "to get through it" (1 Tim 6: 17), so that everyone can enjoy it.
this means that Christian conversion requires us to reconsider "especially all that affect social order and the search of the common good."
as a consequence, no one can expect us to limit religion for the secret intimacy of people, without any influence on social and national life, without taking into account the health of civil society institutions, without expressing our soul on the events that interfere with citizens.
who will deny to close the message of St Francis of Assisi and Beata Teresa of Calcutta?
if they had not accepted.
authentic faith - never looking for comfort or is individualist - always implies a profound desire to change the world, to transmit values, leaving something better we have seen in the world.
we love this planet from the beautiful on which God is being found, and love the humanity that binds it, with its tragedies and hearts, with its desires and tasks, with its values and weaknesses.
the world is our common home and all we brothers.
even if "the fair order of society and the State is a central duty of politics," the Church "cannot nor should it be honoured by the striking to have justice." [150] All Christians, even the shepherd, are called to care for a better world.
we are talking, because the social thought of the Church is very positive and deposited, to move towards action that brings about change, and in this sense it does not give it a sign of hope that is a heart of Jesus Christ' s love.
at the same time, it combines its commitment to what they perform in the social field churches and other ecclesial Communities, both at a level of doctrine reflection and on practical poison. "[151]
there is no need to open up on the major social issues affecting today' s world, some of which have already commented on them in the second chapter.
this is not a social document, and to reflect on those various thematic better make use of a very good tool that is that of the Church' s Social Doctrine Compendum, which truly recommends its use and study.
Moreover, neither the Pope nor the Church have in their hands the monopoly of interpreting social realities or the proposal for solutions to our time problems.
I am indemnity what is clearly uriena Paul VI: "I have served so different from each other, difficult to pronounce one word and suggest a solution of universal value.
from the rest, this is neither our ambition nor mission.
Christian communities who want to analyse objectively the situation of their country. "[152]
in the following to try to concentrate on two major issues that seem to be fundamental at this point of history.
we will develop them more widely because I believe they are determinant for the future of humanity.
we are talking, firstly, about the social inclusion of the poor, and then on peace and social dialogue.
from our faith in Christ that has become poor, and was always close to the poor and the steam, come our fear for the full development of those most members of society.
united with God, listen to a karba
every Christian and community are called to be a tool in God for the release and promotion of the poor, so that they can fully integrate into society; this calls for us to be able to be able to listen to the heart of the poor and speed up it.
the Scripture is enough to discover how the Father would like to listen to the heart of the poor: "I have heard the suffering of my people in Egypt.
and I heard their carba because of their arguments and recognised their pain.
now I' ve selected to get them..
let' s, then, I will be sent to you! "(e. g. 3: 7 - 8,10), and he is careful to their needs:" And children Israel have told the Lord, and the Lord bring them a savior "(Mħ 3: 15).
if we have taken a ear for that karba, when we are God' s tool to listen to the poor, remain outside God' s will and from his plan, because that poor "shoots the Lord against your and you have guilt" (Death 15: 9).
and the lack of solidarity with its needs directly affects our relationship with God: "If you are hungry in his heart, his claim will hear his Creator" (Sir 4: 6).
returning to the old question: "Mela if one should live in the world and see his brother in need and close his heart, how can God' s love be swallowed in it?" (1 Jn 3: 17).
we also remember what conviction the Apostle Jacbu reapes the image of the carba of the injured: "See, the payment of workers who have taken your fields - a payment you have kept them with the roots - is bright against you, and the crying of those who felt to come to the ears of the Lord of exercise" (5: 4).
the word "solidarity" has lost some of its power and sometimes misunderstanding, because in truth it means too much more than any action of generosity here and here.
calls for a new mentality to be created in terms of community, where, in relation to wealth in the hands of the little, priority is the life of all together.
solidarity is a spontaneous response of the recognition that the social function of property and universal destination of wealth are realities that come before private property.
the private ownership of wealth is justified if this wealth intends and foster it better for the common good, and therefore solidarity must live as the decision to return to the poor what he is.
these convictions and solidarity practices, when they cope with crops, open the way to other structural changes and make them possible.
a change in structures that do not create new convictions and answers would lead to the same structures today or tomorrow being corrupt, pisants and without free fruits.
sometimes this means that we want to open our ears to the car of full peoples, the poorest peoples on the ground, because "peace is set up not only on respect for human rights, but also on that towards the rights of the peoples." [154] With the heart say that even human rights can be used as a justification for a harsh defence of individual rights or the rights of the most rich peoples. "
while respecting the independence and culture of each nation, we must keep in mind that this planet is of all humanity, and that the mere fact that they have been born in a place that has fewer resources or less development, does not justify some living with less dignity than others.
we need to believe that "those who are more good luck should give some of their rights to put their wealth to the service of others." [155] We can talk properly about our rights, we want to broaden our hearts and open our ears to the car of other nations or other regions of our country.
we need to grow in solidarity in a way that "allows all people the power to draw up each," [156] the same as "every man is born to develop himself." [157]
when we see their fees, we hear their achievements and understand their suffering, we scandalise our soul when we know that there is sufficient food for all and that the hunger is due to the bad distribution of wealth and profit.
the problem grows with the general practice of waste. "[158]
but we still want more than so, our dreams grow more in the high.
we are not only talking on ensuring food or "adequate maintenance" to all, but also on "prosperity in its various aspects." [159] This calls for education, access to health services, and especially work, for free, creative, participatory and solid work, man expresses and growing in the dignity that gives his life. "
with one appropriate wage you can have access to another wealth that is being used by all.
faithful to the Gospel not to require somewhat
the need to listen to the heart of our heart when we are at the heart of our heart, we will allow us to raise the suffering of others.
read again some learning that gives us the Word of God on mercy, to rebuild strongly in the life of the Church.
the Gospel proclaimes: "Blessed those who shelter, because they find mercy" (Mt 5: 7).
the Apostle Jacbu teaches that mercy with others come to us winning in the divin judgment: "So you should speak and so you should bring you a soul, as if he had arrived in order to bring you under a law of freedom.
for the descend to be un mercyful for those who do not show mercy; and mercy will win on the belly "(2: 12 - 13).
in this silence, James shows that he is an heir of the great richness of the Jewish spiritity of the post- exilee, that mercy would give it a high saveic value: "inflicted from your land with good crops, and from your brother, by shelter for the saints; it is certainly extended for you the time of the graft" (Dan 4: 24).
in this same perspective, the sacrifical literature speaks about the elemosine as a concrete operation of mercy with those who need: "The charity is self - emitted from death, and employs you from all sides" (Tob 12: 9).
this idea is more tangible expressed in Sirak Son: "Water is shifting fire, and charity makes good for sins" (3: 30).
the same synthesis is found in the new will: "On all, you will have full love towards each other, because love has been sent to a cotre of sins" (1 Pt 4: 8).
this mentality is strongly taken into account the intention of Church Father and served as prophhetic resistance, as a cultural alternative, to the individualism of a payee.
we only mention one example: "How, in the danger of burning, we speed up water to lose it, [...] in the same way, if from the heart of our straw straw straw stops are shifting the flame of the sin and this narrow thing, as soon as we come to us a day of mercy, we will be like if it was a source of water we are offering us to lose fires." [160]
it is a truly clear message, so direct, so simple and elocent, that no ecclesial?
the Church' s reflection on these texts has no iddallam or weaken their exortative sense, but rather helps us with all courage and ourselves.
why do I complicate what is so simple?
the conceptual tool is there to favour contact with the reality you want to explain better and not to predict it.
this goes above all to the warnings of the Scripture which strongly invitates for the love of brothers, humble and generous service, justice, mercy with the poor.
Jesus, with his words and manage, and show what is this way in which we can recognise others.
why did I teach what is so clear?
not only we should see that we do not fall into doctrine errors, but even remain faithful to this surround of life and knowledge.
because "sometimes they are 'orthodoxia' defenders who are forgotten due to their passivity, over- tolerance, and their complicity have been guilty of intolerable situations of injustice and political regimes that allow them." [161]
when St Paul went on to the Apostles in Jerusalem to discern well if he was overwhelmingly occurring or was slightly mirror (see Gal 2: 2), the criterion - Key of authenticity that showed him was not to be forgotten the poor (see Gal 2: 10).
this great criterion, so that the communities set up by Paul are not carried out by the style of individual wage life, is very true in the context of our time, where the tendency is to find a new individualist wage.
we will not always be able to show best the same beauty of the Gospel, but there is a sign that should never fail: the choice for the last among the young, in favour of those that the embarkation and disposal society.
sometimes we are too hard in our heart and in our thought, we forget, naljenaw our head, we grasp from the unfounded possibilities of consumption and distraction that offers us this society.
a species of alienation affecting all, because "a society is alienated if its forms of social organisation or production and consumption, make it harder to give solidarity between the peoples." [162]
the precious place of the poor within the People of God
in the heart of God there is a preferential place for the poor, so that he himself "poor" (2 Cor 8: 9).
the whole journey of our faith is marked by the poor.
this redemption was lost through the "yes" of humble ribs from a small village lost somewhere in the bishops of great imperuity.
the Feddej was born in a manpower, heart of livestock, as was happening in the case of the poorest children; it was presented in the Temple with par gamiem, the offer of those who did not have to buy a lamb (see Lk 2: 24; Lev 5: 7); he grown in a house of simple workers and worked with his own hands to earn what they eat.
when he began to announce the arrival of the kingdom, followed him a large crowd of those who have all raised everything, so he showed that he himself had said: "The Spirit of the Lord on me, because he is consecrated.
I sent me the good bands to the summer "(Lk 4: 18).
to those who were affected by suffering, predicted by poverty, he ensured that God was keeping them at the heart of his heart: "Blessed the poor in the spirit, for which he is the kingdom of heaven" (Lk 6: 20); and with them identified himself: "I was hungry and I have touched me," and he said that mercy to them is the key to the heaven (see Mt 25: 35 s).
for the Church, the choice in favour of the poor is a theological category before it is cultural, sociological, political or philosophical.
God shall pay his first mercy. "[163] This divine preference has consequences for the life of the faith of all Christians, called to" think like Christ Jesus "(Fil 2: 5).
it is surrounded by it, the Church has made a choice in favour of the poor that is 'special form of what is to come first in the exercise of Christian love, as evidenced by the tradition of the Church. "[164] This choice - for us Benedict XVI -" is implicit in Christian faith in what God has become poor, so that with his poverty we can build we. "[165] He therefore I would like a poor Church for the poor."
they have much to teach us.
Moreover, they share in faith, with their suffering they meet Christ who suffer.
we need all to let them evangelize us.
the new evangelization is an invitation to recognise the faithful power of their lives and put them at the heart of the Church' s journey.
we contain called to discover Christ, offer them our voice to their causes, but even to be their friends, listen to them, understand them and welcome the mysterious knowledge that God wants to give us through them.
our commitment should not be translated exclusively into schools and promotion and aid programmes; what the Spirit raises not over- activeism, but rather attention to the other "by taking into account as it was one of us ourselves." [166] This attention of love is the beginning of real concern for his person and we have to leave it so that we can effectively seek his wealth.
this requires us to appreciate the poor in his same way, with what he, with his culture, how he lives faith.
the authentic love is always contemplative, gives us that we have given us not to the need or vanity, but because the other person is beautiful, there is from the outside appearance.
"from the love in which we find fun in the other person is to offer it something free." [167] The poor, when he was loved, "he is considered high value," [168] and that it makes different the true choice for the poor from other ideology, was that it was, from any attempt to use the poor for the service of personal or political interests.
to the poor we can only get them truly in the journey of their freedom if we seek to be close to them truly with love.
this only makes it possible that "the poor in each community feel 'in their home'.
it is not this best way and the most effective way to present the good news and kingdom?. "[169] Without the preferential choice for the poorest," the good news of the Gospel, in which it itself is the first form of charity, is in danger of being misunderstanding or destroyed by a quantity of words by which we are surrounded in the communication society within our time. "[170]
once this Exemption is addressed to members of the Catholic Church, with the heart I would like to say that the worst discrimination being done with the poor is the lack of spiritual attention.
most of the poor are open especially to faith; God' s need and we cannot offer them his friendship, his barka, his Word, the celebration of the sacrament and the growing moving proposal and mature faith.
the preferential choice in favour of the poor should translate itself mainly into a pre - shipment religious attention, and this is foremost.
No one should say that he promises from the poor because his life options call for him to pay more attention to other responsibilities.
this is excuse that often hears in academic, business or professional environments, and even in ecclesial ones.
however, I am aware of the opening of a heart and in the right provisions of Christians, and I ask you to seek new ways to remain this renewed proposal as communities.
economy and income distribution
the need to find a solution to the structural causes of poverty cannot expect more, not only because of the pragmatic demand seeking results and to bring an order in society, but because society needs to be pursued by a weakening disease and create just a whole and can only lead it to new crises.
aid projects, which respond to any urgency arising, should only be regarded as provisional answers.
if they are not solved by their roots the problems of the poor, as they say to the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and combating the structural causes of inequality, [173] they will not solve the problems of the world and no other problem.
the lack of equality is the root of all social evil.
the dignity of each human person and the common good are issues that have to disseminate all economic policy, but sometimes more like some appendices added outside a political speech which has neither a future perspective nor truly full development programmes.
how many words have been scored for this system!
he said, "the EU should not be able to do so."
this wording is often an object of opportunistic manipulation that brings nothing.
indifference to this concern, from its comfortable seat, empow our lives and our words from each meaning.
the vocation of business is noble work, provided that it leaves it a broader meaning of life; this helps to make a true servant of the common good, with its effort to foster and make it more accessible to all the well of this world.
we can' t trust more in the shape and invisible market power.
in order to increase justice there is something more than the economy grows, even if it relies on it, because it calls for decisions, programmes, mechanisms and processes that are specifically oriented towards a better distribution of money revenue, to create job opportunities, towards full promotion of the poor that goes beyond the mere aid services.
I am not proposing irresponsible popularism, but the economy cannot continue to seek solutions that are like a new poison, such as when it claims to raise the level of profits by hindering the labour market and thereby creating more exclusion.
I ask God to increase the number of politicians that have the ability to enter into an authentic dialogue that effectively seeks to cure deep roots and not only the appearance of our world' s evil!
it is essential that those governing and financial health raise their work and broaden their perspective, making a dignified work, education and health service for all citizens.
and why do not turn to God to prolong them in their plans?
I am convinced that if we leave this opening to the descent, we can achieve a new political and economic mentality that helps us to respect the absolute dictomy between the common economy and social wealth.
the economy, as evidenced by the same word, should be the art leading to the proper administration of the common home, which is the world as a whole.
any economic action of certain importance, carried out in some part of our planet, leaves its effect on the whole rest; therefore no government may act outside common responsibility.
in fact, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find solutions at local level to the huge contradictions that exist at global level, and therefore local policy is filled with problems requiring a solution.
if we really want to come to a strong global economy, in this history phase we need a more efficient way of interaction that, without neglecting the sovereignty of nations, ensures the economic wealth of all countries and not just a few of them.
every community of the Church, if in any way it claims that you can stay with her death without seeking creative way to take care of and strive with fruit for the poor to live with dignity and for everyone to feel including, it would also risk being free, even if you speak on social issues or criticises governments.
it does not last too to swallow in the spiritual mondanity, hidden under the cover of religious practices, with many meetings that do not prevent fruit and many discourse in the empty.
if someone feels off with climate, I say that this is giving love and good intentions, there are from any personal interest or political ideology.
my word is not that of any still nor someone who wants to take it against someone else.
it is only interested in striving that those who are the corner of an individualist, indifferent and self -ista mentality, can be released from those chains without due regard and arrive at a life - style and more human thought, more noble, which leaves more fruit, which gives dignity to their journey in this world.
Jesus, the evangelizer per excellence and the same Gospel, identifies himself especially with the poor (see Mt 25: 40).
this reminds us that we all as Christians called to take care of the weakest in the world.
but in the current 'success "model and' private life," it seems not to make sense to invest in order to restore those who have remained behind, weak and those who are not hungry with so talents, move forward in life.
it is indivisable to be attending to approach new trends of poverty and weakness where we are called to recognise Christ suffering, even if this does not seem to be establishing any tangible and immediate advantages: those who do not have a self - roof, those who fell in some addiction, refugees, indigenous peoples, the elderly increasingly alone and lost, and so on.
I say to me, immigrants present me a particular challenge, because I am a young Church without borders that feels it a mother of all.
I therefore ask countries to open their hearts more generously, who are still afraid to change local identity, find the ability to create new cultural synthesis.
how many cities are able to win the scoreboard to kill, and to do from such integration a new development factor!
how beautiful those cities that, even in their architectural design, are filled with connecting spaces, create a relationship, favour the knowledge of the other person!
we always manage the situation of those who are victims of the various forms of trafficking in people.
I would like everyone to listen to God' s karba that can all ask us: "Where is you?" (Gen 4: 9).
where is you breaking?
where is what day you are being killed in that smalllandestine factory, in the net of prostitution, in children used to stay up, in what is working with hidden for his work against the law?
let us not take our soul that is not happening.
many are involved.
the question costs everyone!
in our cities we have sent this mafious crime and those who deserve it, and many have their hands with blood due to their comfortable and silent complicity.
poorly they are women suffering from a situation of exclusion, ill- treatment or violence, because they often find themselves in little possibilities to defend their rights.
however, among them are still continuing to find the most ammireable management of everyday life erosion in defending and fearing the weakness of their families.
among these boats, that the Church with great fear would like to take care of them, there are also infants still in the womb, which are the most innocent and cannot defend themselves, that today there is those who want to deprive them of human dignity so that they can do with what they rise, deserve their lives and insists that laws be made to prevent anyone from being set up.
often, to pay for the defence of the Church in favour of the life of infants in the womb, try to present its position as ideological, dark and conservative.
but this protection of life in the womb is closely linked to the protection of any other human rights.
it is built on the conviction that every human life is always sacred and invisible, in every situation and at every stage of its development.
it is an objective in itself and is never a means of solving other difficulties.
if this conviction is permitted, sound and permanent foundations for the protection of human rights, which are always subject to changing convenience according to the need for power holders.
the reason alone is sufficient to help us recognise the inviolable value of every human life, but if we look at it from the eyes of faith, "every collection of the dignity of the human person calls for a vendetta to God, and shall be regarded as an offence made to God who left man." [176]
as it is a matter relating to coherence have been wounded of our message on the value of the human person, we should not expect the Church to change its position on this argument.
I would like to be completely honest on so.
this is not an argument subject to any form of reforms or "modernisation."
it is not advisable if it claims that problems can be solved by destroying human life.
but it is also true that we have just done to accede adequately to women who find themselves very hard, where abortion seems to be seen before them as the rapid solution to the strong sense of guilt they have, particularly when the growing life in which fruit of violence or in a context of extreme poverty has been created.
who can' t understand situations of such heart pain?
there are also other weak and defense claims, which are often lost for mercy of economic interests or unfair exploitation.
we are talking about creation as a whole reality.
as humans we are not only beneficiaries, but look of the other creatures.
through the reality of our body, God has so helped us something with the world around us, that soil desertification is like a disease for each of us, and we can continue the extinction of some species as if we were being slaughtered part of our own body.
who changed the so beautiful world of the sea in underwater cimeteries raised by all life and colour? "[178]
we have little but raised in God' s love, as St. Francis of Assisi, we all Christians called to take care of the weakness of the people and the world in which we live.
III.
common good and social peace
we spoke very about joy and love, but God' s Word also mentions the fruit of peace (see Gal 5: 22).
social peace can not be understood as being illiteracy or as the mere lack of violence achieved by a party imposing itself on the other.
it would still be false peace as a excuse to justify a social organisation that seeks to lock or restrict the poorest, in such a way that those who enjoy most wealth can keep their lifestyle without any toxic, while others live as they can.
the request for social rights, linked to the distribution of income, social inclusion of the poor and human rights, cannot be challenged with the pretext to reach consensus around a table or for short- term peace that only contests the minority.
the dignity of the human person and the common good are above the tranquillity of some who do not want to deprive of their privileges.
when transmitting these values, prophhetic voice is needed.
peace "is not only a lack of war, as if it consisted of a certain balance of forces, which is never firm.
peace is worked with the ongoing work from one day to day, provided that the order established by God and calls for a more perfect justice between humans. "[179] It is ensured that peace which is not fruitful of the full development of all, nor a future has and continues to be seeds of new conflicts and of many kinds of violence.
those living in each nation develop the social dimension of their lives by living in responsible citizens within a people, not as a mass borne by the dominant forces.
we remember that "being a faithful citizen is and the share in political life is a moral obligation." [180] But that it is a people is something more, and calls for a continuous process in which every new generation involves itself fully.
it is a hard work that takes a long term and calls for us to integrate ourselves and learn to do so in order to build a culture of the meeting in harmony of many trends.
to move forward in this building of people in peace, justice and fraternity, there are four principles related to bipolar tensions that find them in all social reality.
it follows from the fundamental principles of the Church' s Social Doctrine, which constitute the 'first fundamental parameter of reference to the interpretation and assessment of social phenomena. "[181] In the light of this, I would now propose these four principles specifically aligning the development of social convivalents and the building of people where differences come into harmony with each other within the framework of a common project.
this is convinced that their application can be an authentic way towards peace within each nation and worldwide.
time is better than space
between what is full and what is limited there is a tension that attracts to two opposite sides.
the full sense proves the desire to have everything, while the limit is the wall we find before us.
"time," if we consider it in a broad sense, looks at what is full as an expression of the move opened before us, while every moment alone is an expression of the limit we live in a closed space.
citizens live in a tension between the link together with the moment and the light of time, the bigger jaw, uteropia that opens us for the future as a final cause attracting it.
here comes the first principle to move forward in the building of a people: time is better than space.
this principle allows us to work in the long term, without forgotten from the obcession to achieve immediate results.
we help us to find difficult situations or to counter ourselves, or the changes of the plans it imposes on us the dynamism of reality.
it is an invitation to do our tension between what is full and what is limited, and give priority to time.
one of the sins which sometimes see in socio - political activity consists of protecting power spaces instead of the time of processes.
if we give priority to space we will shelter to solve everything at the time of now, to try to present all the spaces of our power and affirmation.
it means formalising processes and we expect that we can stop them.
give priority to time means that we see that we start processes rather than possess spaces.
the time orders spaces, lighting them and stabilises them in growing chain links, without taking steps back.
here we will promote actions that generate new dynamics in society and include persons and other groups that continue to lead it forward, provided they leave fruit in important historical events.
without fear, but with clear convictions and a death penalty.
sometimes I ask myself who are those in our world that are actually taking care of life to processes that build people, rather than gaining immediate results that produce easy, quick and short- term political profit, but that they do not fear the full human.
the story perhaps judged them with that criterion which writes on Romano Guard: "The only model for successfully assessing epoka is to ask to what extent it is developing and arrive at its true reason the milestone of human existence, in accordance with the particular character and the possibilities of that same age." [182]
this criterion also lives for evangelization, which requires that we keep the clear move before our eyes, to adopt possible processes and reduce the long way.
the Lord himself lives on this ground has shown how many times his disciples that there were things that were still unable to understand them and that there was a need to expect the Holy Spirit (see Jn 16: 12 - 13).
the grain and gut parrabble (see Mt 13: 24 - 30) describes an important aspect of evangelization, i. e. what we show how we can still occupy the Kingdom' s space and causes damage to the bowel, but is salted by the grain tons which appear over time.
unity wins over the conflict
the conflict cannot be ignored or hidden.
it must be accepted.
but if we remain caught in it, we lose the prospect, the move limits itself and the reality itself remains divided into a piece of thousand.
when we enter the conflicts, we lose the sense of the profound unity of reality.
before the conflict, some simply look at him and remain like it was never free, they hide them to continue moving with their lives.
others enter the conflict in such a way as to remain felt by it, lose the jaw, put on their institutions their confusions and delusions, thus making unity impossible.
but there is the third way, the best one, how to bring itself to the conflict.
he accepts to bear the conflict, repair it and change in a link combining a new process.
"We are those who bring peace" (Mt 5: 9).
in this way, the possibility of spreading a community in differences, striving for only those noble persons who have courage go beyond the shell of conflicts and take account of others of their deepest dignity.
it is therefore necessary to look at a principle that is indispensable to build social friendship: unity wins over the conflict.
solidarity, if we understand it within its most profound meaning to challenge us, so it becomes a style of how history is built, a living environment where conflicts, tensions and opposite can reach a unity of several forms that bring a new life.
it does not mean that we have recourse to synctitism, nor to a reality where it is spread in the other, but to the agreement on a higher plan encompassing the precious potential of the irregularities that are in contrast to each other.
this evangelical criterion reminds us that Christ brought everything in itself: heaven and land, God and man, time and eternity, body and soul, person and society.
the sign from which we recognise this unity and reconciliation of everything inH is peace.
Christ "is our peace" (Efes 2: 14).
the announcement of the Gospel always opens with the hope of peace, and peace will be insured and sealed at all times relations between the disciples.
peace can take place because the Lord wins the world and the lasting conflicts in it by 'with his blood, spread on the cross, peace was brought "(Col 1: 20).
but if we are in the depth of these Biblical texts, we discover that the first place in which we are called to arrive at this peace despite the differences is our own people, our life, always threatened by remembrance and sharing. [183] With our hearts divided into a piece would be difficult to build an authentic social peace.
the announcement of peace is not one of peace negotiated, but the conviction that the unity of the Spirit brings harmony between all differences.
win on any conflict in new synthesis that plant us hearts.
diversity is beautiful when accepting all time in a reconciliation process, provided that it saves species of cultural pact leading to "reconciled diversity," as well as the bishops of Congo: "The diversity of our ethnicity is a great wealth [...] With unity, by converting hearts and reconciliation only we can move forward to our country." [184]
reality is higher than the idea
there is also a bipolar tension between the idea and reality.
the reality simply is, while the idea is elaborated.
between the two there should be continuous dialogue, and avoid the idea ending from reality.
it is dangerous that we live in our kingdom of the word alone, nets, sophisticism.
it is clear from here that there is a need to seek the third principle: reality is higher than the idea.
this calls for us to avoid many trends of reality imprisonment: angle purives, totalitarianism of what is relative, empty rhtoric, more formal than real projects, anti - stocking fundamental, ethical systems that do not seek true wealth, intellectual property dry from each knowledge.
the idea - conceptual elaborations - is there to help us find, understand and give direction to reality.
the idea cut from reality opens the way for idealism and nominalism that do not allow effect, which may perhaps reach to classify or defend, but do not live.
what actually involves is the surrounded reality of reasoning.
we need to pass through formal nominalism for harmonious objectivity.
otherwise the truth is manipulated, the same as the gymmetry replaces the cosmetic. [185] We have political - and even religious leaders - who ask why the people do not understand and follow them, when their proposals are so logical and clear.
this is likely to be lost in the kingdom of pure ideas, and the policies or faith have brought them only rettoric.
others have been simplicity and implanted from abroad that for people is foreign.
reality is better than the idea.
this criterion is linked to the incarnation of the Word and its performance in practice: "The spirit of God recognizes him by this: every spirit, which states that Jesus Christ became man, is by God" (1 Jn 4: 2).
the reality criterion of Word which has already been held and always seeks to cope, is essential for evangelization.
on the one hand, we give value to the history of the Church as a history of salvation, to remind our saints that we grow the Gospel in the life of our nations, to recognise how much the bimillenary tradition of the Church, without claiming that we should elaborate some form of thought not cut from this treasury, as if we want us to re - persuade the Gospel we.
on the other hand, this criterion leads us to put in practice the Word, to carry out works of justice and charity where this Word can leave fruit.
if we do not put it into practice, if the Word does not deliver it to reality, we will build on sand, remain united in the pure idea and we have ended up in intimidation and concise that they do not prevent fruit, bringing its dynamism sterile.
everything is better than the party
even between globalisation and localisation there is tension.
we need to pay attention to the global dimension not to fall in the medoc integrity that brings about everyday life.
at the same time, we don' t want to forget what is local, to keep us rose with the land.
everything is too much more than the party, and it is also more than the pool of the parties together.
therefore, we must not be overwhelmingly mind with limited and particular issues.
we must always be heard to recognise too much greater wealth that would benefit us all.
but this needs to do it without be afraid, without being killed by our roots.
we need to be put to us well in fertile land and in the history of the place where we live, which is a gift of God.
we should work in the cocon, in what is close to our close, but always with too much broader outlook.
likewise, a person who maintains its particular characteristics and does not hide its identity, when it integrates itself well within a community, is not being sourced but receives a new evocation for its own development.
on the one hand, the global sphere will not be prepared to man, but on the other hand, nor the preference for the party will not make it sterile.
the model is not the globe - which is not better than the parties - where each point is equally promised by the centre and there are no differences between point and the other.
the model is asthma, reflecting the combination of all parties in which they retain their originality.
both pastoral and political action seek to collect in this asthma the best of each and one.
there is the poor, with their culture, their projects and their bridgeets.
even people who can be criticised for their errors have something what they do not want to be lost.
it is the unity between the peoples, which, in universal order, retain their particular characteristics; is the totality of people in a society seeking a common good that truly encompasses everyone in one body.
to us Christians this principle also speaks us about the totality and integrity of the Gospel that the Church must pass to humans and send us broadcast.
all his wealth encompasses both school and workers, both traders and artists, to everyone.
the "popular mystic" in its way welcomes the Gospel as a whole and keeps up in prayers, fraternity, justice, fight and feast expressions.
the Good news is the joy of Father who does not want to be lost by his tiny.
the joy of the Good Love is going to meet the lost and returned to him in his skinny.
the Gospel is a yeast to bring all the dough and a city that dives on the height of the mountain and illuminated all nations.
the Gospel has a criterion of totality to which it is intrinsic: it never ceases to be Good News unless it has been announced to everyone, unless it leaves fruit and reinstates all human dimensions, and unless it connects all humans around the table of the Kingdom.
everything is better than the party.
social dialogue as a contribution to peace
evangelization also calls for a journey of dialogue.
the Church should in particular three areas in which it is necessary to present, to carry out a service leading to the full development of human beings and continue to seek the common good: dialogue with the States, society - which also includes dialogue with cultures and sciences - and with other people who believe, although they do not belong to the Catholic Church.
in all cases, "the Church in its speech leaves from that light that it offers faith," [186] shares its experience of one thousand years and always keeps the eyes of the lives and suffering of human beings.
this goes beyond the human reason, but also has a meaning that it can give me to those who do not mention and calls on the reason to broaden its prospective.
the Church published the Gospel of peace "(Efes 6: 15) and is open to collaboration with all national and international authorities to take care of this great universal wealth.
the main author, the historical subject of this process, are its people and culture, not some class, some of the people, a group, some élite.
we don' t need a little project addressed to the few, otherwise some minority surrounded or witnessed under collective sentiment.
this means one view to living together, in a single social and cultural pact.
the State shall protect and bring forward the common good of society. [23] On the basis of the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity, and in a strong effort of political dialogue and the creation of consensus, it plays a fundamental role, which cannot delegate it to someone, in seeking the full development of all.
this role, in the circumstances of our time, calls for a great social humility.
in dialogue with the State and society, the Church does not have solutions to all particular issues.
however, together with the various social agents, it has partner those proposals that can best respond to human dignity and to the common good.
it and does so, always clearly propose the fundamental values of human life, to transmit convictions that can then translate themselves into political actions.
dialogue between faith, reason and sciences
the faith is not afraid of the reason; on the contrary, seeks it and has trust in it, because "the light of the reason and that of the faith come both from God," [191] and cannot go against each other.
evangelization is attending to scientific progressive to illuminate them with the light of the faith and natural law, will increasingly respect the centrality and supreme value of the human person at all stages of its existence.
society as a whole can give us thanks to this dialogue that opens both new approaches to thought and broaden the possibilities of reason.
even this is a path of harmony and leading to peace.
the Church does not claim that the progress of sciences can be put in place.
on the contrary, congratulates and even enjoys it and acknowledges the huge potential that God gave to the human mind.
when the progress of sciences, while academic seriousness remain within the framework of their specific object, leads to a clear conclusion that the reason cannot reject, is not until the faith that goes against it.
too less than believing that a scientific opinion boiling, and that there is currently sufficient evidence for it, should have the same weight as a sum of faith.
but, on some occasions, some scientists go beyond the formal object of their discipline and balancing themselves with claims or conclusions out of their scientific field.
here, it is not the reason that they are trying to propose, but a specific ideology, to close the way for authentic, peaceful and fruitful dialogue.
ecumenical dialogue
the Ecumenical commitment is a response to the Lord' s request that "all of them" (Jn 17: 21).
the credibility of the Christian announcement would have been too much greater if Christians won the divisions between them and the Church has recognised the media of its catholyity in those children who are truly joined with us with Baptism but are separated from the full unity with it. "[192] We need to keep always in mind that we are pilgrims, and we are all going together.
we need to trust ourselves in the hands of us on the road without any suspicions, without scepticism, and look at what we are looking for: peace in the face of God alone.
we trust us in the other hand is craft, peace is craft.
Jesus said to us: "Blessed those who bring peace" (Mt 5: 9).
in this work, even though we have been carried out the prophecy: "They change their rope in a knife of the hidden" (Is 2: 4).
in this light, ecumenism is a contribution to the unity of the family of humans.
the presence of the Coastantinopli Patriarch, His Holiness Bartilmew I, and of the Archbishop of Canterbury, His Excellence Rowan Douglas Williams, Synod, [193] was an authentic gift of God and precious Christian witnesses.
in view of the misunderstanding evidence given by the number of Christians, particularly in Asia and Africa, it has become more urgent to seek roads towards unity.
the missionaries in those continents often speak about criticism, complaints and even the timetable set out therein due to the scandal of Christians' divisions.
if we focus more on the convictions that deserve us and remember in the principle of hierarchy of truth, we can dash lightly towards common forms of broadcasting, service and witnesses.
we cannot remain in destruction before the so large number of those who did not welcome the announcement of Jesus Christ.
therefore, the commitment to unity to facilitate the meeting with Jesus Christ is no longer simple diplomacy or forced work, but is replaced by an indispensable path of evangelization.
the signs of Christians "divisions in countries already brought about by violence, increase other violence on the part of those who should be a life that brings peace.
they are so much and so dear the things you deserve us!
and if we believe indeed in the free and generous action of the Spirit, how many things we have to learn one of the other!
here we are not just talking about getting information on others to know them better, but we welcome what the Spirit rented as a gift for us also.
to give only one example, in the dialogue with our brothers and sisters, we are Catholics have the possibility to learn something more about what means the episcopal college and their experience of sinodality.
through the division of our dictatorship, the Spirit can always lead us more to truth and to the tighs.
relations with Jews
we look especially to the Jewish people, whose Pact with God never cancel, because "God does not reverse hisons and call" (Romans 11: 29).
the Church, which together with the Jews share an important part of the Holy Scripture, takes into account the people of the Pact and his faith as a holy root of its Christian identity (see Romans 11: 16 - 18).
as Christians we cannot look at the Jewish religion as a foreign one, nor can we consider Jews among those who are called to leave the idles to turn to the true God (see 1 Tess 1: 9).
we believe together with them in one God acting in history, and welcome together with them the Word reveled that is one for both we.
the dialogue and friendship with Israel' s children are part of the life of Jesus' disciples.
the friendship that we have grown us leads us to grading and sincerity in our heart deserve to the unconscious persecution of which they were and are objected, particularly for those in which they or were Christian.
God continues to work in the people of the old Pact and warns treasures of knowledge arising from his meeting with the divine Word.
so even the Church can be welcomed when it welcomes the values of Judaism.
even if there is Christian belief that it is not acceptable for the Jewish religion, and the Church cannot refuse to proclaim Jesus as Lord and Christ, there is rich complementarity that allows us to read together the texts of the Jewish Bible and help each other to discover the richness of the Word, as well as to share with each other several ethical convictions and common concern for justice and the development of nations.
interreligious dialogue
it is at the outset of openness in truth and love that we should build dialogue with members of non- Christian religions, despite the many obstacles and difficulties, particularly fundamentalism by both sides.
this interreligious dialogue is a necessary condition for peace in the world, and is therefore a duty for Christians, as is for other religious communities.
this dialogue is foremost a conversation on human life or simply, as the Bishops of India, "an attitude of openness to them, by sharing in joy and in their nets." [194] I can learn to accept others in the different way of living, think and express themselves.
with this method, we can together enter the duty to share justice and peace, which must become a fundamental criterion of each exchange we have.
a dialogue in which we seek social peace and justice is in itself, there is from the simply practical aspect, an ethical commitment to create new social conditions.
efforts on a specific theme can be changed in a process where, with each other' s hearing, both parties can relieve and can be built.
therefore, even these efforts can have the meaning of love for truth.
in this dialogue, always with cordial friendship, we should never neglect the essential link between dialogue and announcement, leading the Church to maintain and intensify relations with non- Christian ones. [23] The synergistic ultimately not except the totalitarianism of those who claim that they can collect everything together and remove those values above them and cannot decide on them.
the real opening calls for a strong, clear identity, but also open "to understand those of the other" and "that the dialogue can give me to each." [196] We do not need diplomatic opening, saying yes all to avoid problems, as this would be misleading by the other and deprive of the wealth he received as a gift and should share generosity with others.
evangelization and interreligious dialogue should not only be against each other, but we invite each other and enjoy one of the other. [197]
in our time it has particular importance the relationship with Muslims, today particularly present in many countries of Christian tradition where they can freely celebrate theirult and live integrated into society.
at the same time, many of them are convinced of the bottom that their lives, all of them, is God and for me.
we also recognise the need to respond to God with ethical commitment and mercy with the poorest.
in order to strengthen dialogue with Islam, we need to focus properly to those involved in it, not only to build firmly and of course in their identity, but to have the ability to recognise the values of others, understand the concerns related to what they are demanding and deserve light on the common convictions.
we must welcome love and respect Muslim immigrants arriving on our shores, as we want and pray that we are welcome and respected we in the countries of Islamic tradition.
I pray and humidity call on these countries to ensure freedom of Christians to celebrate theirult and live their faith, bearing in mind the freedom to enjoy Muslims in Western countries!
in the face of violent fundamentalism that felt us, respect for those who authentically believe in Islam should lead us to the generalisation of abstract generalisations, because the true Islam and the proper interpretation of the Q' and to take it against all forms of violence.
the same Spectrum raises any trends of practical knowledge that help man bear the suffering of life and lives with more peace and harmony in his heart.
we can also benefit from this rich that continued to be strengthened with the centuries range, which can help us better live our particular convictions.
social dialogue in the context of religious freedom
if so, it is sure to create a new form of discrimination and authoritarianism.
respect for the minorities of anostics or atej must not necessarily impose that the convictions of most believers or honour the richness of religious traditions.
Finally, he said that the EU should not be able to do so.
we and take into account both religion influences people, we need to choose between different ways of living.
both intellectual and journalistic comments often fall into layered generalisations and little academics when speaking about the defects of religions and often do not know that not all believers - nor all religious authorities - are not the same.
some politicians profit from this confusion to justify discriminatory actions.
the writings created in a framework of religious conviction, and we hope that classical religious texts can offer significance to talk to every time, have a power to give purpose and open new horizons, encourage thought, broaden mind and sensibility.
they are weakened due to the narrow vision of certain rationalism.
does it make sense and is it intelligent to leave them for darkness simply because they were born in the context of any religious belief?
they contain strong humanistic principles, which have rational value even if they are bold by religious symbols and learning.
as people of faith we feel close to even those who, even if they do not feel part of a religious tradition, are genuinely seeking truth, beauty and beauty, for us to find the highest expression and their eye in God.
we see them as precious allies in commitment to the protection of human dignity, for the beginning of a peace agreement between peoples and in the protection of creation.
a particular space is that of the so - called Areopaghi, such as the "Bitħa of Jentili," where "well believers and who can not debate on the fundamental themes of ethics, art, and science, and on searching descent." [204] Today this is a way towards peace for our victory world.
I have been killed by some social themes, important for the future of humanity, to rebuild the social dimension of the Gospel' s broadcasting that we cannot be found by it, in order to encourage all Christians to show it increasingly in their words, and in their knowledge.
avoid evangelization with the Spirit means that they open their heart without fear for the action of the Holy Spirit contain.
in Easter Ħamsin, the Spirit will issue the Apostles themselves and replace them in a proclamation of the great crowds of God, each and one will start to understand in their own language.
in addition, the Holy Spirit strongly sends to proclaim the new news of the Gospel with all courage (parresia), with high voice and at every time and place, poorly against the current.
let us call today, with our lives well founded on prayer, which without any action being at risk of remaining empty and broadcasting at the end of the soul.
Jesus wants evangelizers to proclaim the Good News not only by words, but above all with a life altered by the presence of God.
in the last chapter we will not offer synthesis of Christian spirituality, nor to develop major topics such as prayer, Eucharistic adoration or celebration of faith, to which we already have in our precious magisterial texts and celebrations of large authors.
I don' t expect that I should take a place or I hope like this.
simply I would like to propose some reflections on the spirit of the new evangelization.
when I say that something has a "spirit," this usually indicates that there is an interior cause of suckling, encouraging and giving sense to personal and community action.
evangelization with the spirit is very different from a set of tasks helped as a heavy obligation that simply tolerate it, or I am expressing him even though she goes against our stretches and wishes.
how much I would like to find the words to encourage a more enthusiastic evangelization season, joy, generous, hearts, filled with inside love and energy taken!
but I know that no motivation will be sufficient if in the hearts there is no fire of the Spirit.
without doubt, evangelization with the spirit is evangelization with the Holy Spirit, neither is the soul of the Church that evangelizes.
before proposing some spiritual motivations and suggestions, I call again on the Holy Spirit, to pray to renew, prosecute, give us to the Church to all courage itself to evangelize all nations.
evangelizers with the Spirit means evangelizers who request and work.
from the optics of evangelization, neither mention the mystical proposals without a strong social commitment and missionary, nor the speeches and social and pastoral practice without spirituality to change the heart.
such proposals, in pieces or disseminated, only reach small groups and do not have the power to spread at a wide level, because they limit the Gospel.
we need always strive to create an area of interior that gives a Christian sense to our work and activity. [205] Without long adoration time, of a meeting at prayer with God' s Word, of sincere dialogue with the Lord, our tasks are easily shifted from significance, we feel weak due to fatigue and difficulties, and the encouraged to be forgotten.
the Church cannot pass without the breath of prayer, and I congratulate not just that you are continuing in all ecclesial institutions the groups of prayer, intercession, the reading of the Word in a prayer environment, the perpetual adoration of Eucharist.
at the same time, "we need to stop the temptation to propose a privatised and individualistic spirituality that does not agree with what we ask for us love, not to mention the implications of incarnation." [206] There is a risk that some moments of prayer become excuse to prevent our lives in the mission, for privatisation of lifestyle could lead Christians to finding refuge in some false spirituality. "
it is appropriate to remember in the first Christians and so brothers during the history that were filled with joy, expressed by courage, free of charge in broadcasting and perseverants in their activity.
you find those who consume because it says that it was now harder; however, we need to recognise that the context of the Roman Empire was neither favourable to the broadcasting of the Gospel, nor was it for the fight against justice, or for the protection of human dignity.
at every time of history we are present human weakness, the misunderstanding of I, comfortable self -ism and, undoubtedly, the attractiveness to the evil that we threaten all.
this reality is always present, now under this cover and now under the other; it comes from the human limit rather than the circumstances.
therefore, I don' t say that today is more difficult; most, it is different.
rather let us learn from the saints that have not been brought before us and face their difficulties.
we therefore propose you to understand certain motivations that can help us to imitate them within our time. [207]
personal meeting with Jesus' love to save us
the first motivation for evangelization is the love of Jesus that we have received, the experience of the faith that He has brought us and drive us to love it ever more.
but, what love is what does not feel the need to speak about the loved person, present it, makes it known?
if we don' t feel the strong desire to pass it to others, we need to stop at prayer to pray it again and to keep us behind it.
we need to learn every day, pray him his grace to open our cold heart and gauge our life with destruction and superficial.
cast before him with an open heart, let us look at us, let us recognise this look of love that he opened Natanjel on the day that Jesus approached him and said, "Your children under the tree of the tree" (Jn 1: 48).
how much is a beautiful thing that they have lost before a crucifiss, or he has improved us in Jesus Sacramentated legs, and simply I will not be afraid under his eyes!
how good it is for us if we leave it again and our lives and send us to disseminate the new life he gives!
therefore, what happens is that, ultimately, "I proclaim you what we saw and heard" (1 Jn 1: 3).
the best motivation that leads us to proclaim the Gospel is to be contemplated by love, it is that we will stay on its pages and read it with the heart.
if we approach him in this way, his beauty brings us, and every time again to praise us.
it is therefore urgent to re - find that contemplative spirit, which allows us to rediscover daily that we are depositaries of wealth to do more man to man, which help to live a new life.
there is nothing better what we have passed to others.
the whole life of Jesus, the way it was brought to the poor, its management, its coherence, its simpler and daily generosity, and finally its full grant, everything is precious and has a word to tell our personal life.
every time we seek to discover it, persuade our ownselves that is that others need, even if they cannot be wrapped: "What you have his name without recognizing him, I proclaim you" (Acts 17: 23).
sometimes we have lost from the impetus to the mission because we hope that the Gospel has a response to the most profound needs of people, because all we have been created for what we propose us the Gospel: friendship with Jesus and the love of the brothers.
the missionary' s encouraged to announce Christ from a view to responding to this desire. "[208]
enthusiasm in evangelization is based on this conviction.
we have in our hands a treasury of life and love that cannot be embraced with us, the message that can neither manipulate nor mislead.
it is a response that falls at the bottom of the heart of man and which can increase and raise it.
it is the truth that never pass its fashion because it has the ability to arrive at where nothing more can reach.
our nets without end cure only with love without end.
but this conviction is strengthened by personal experience, always renewed, to adjust his friendship and his message.
we cannot always persever in all evangelization encouraged if we do not remain convinced, with the experience we have, that is not the same thing you have inherited to Jesus or not, it is not the same thing to move to him or move in the form, it is not the same thing to hear or ignore his Word, not the same thing contemplates him, rejoice in him, or does not do anything of this.
it is not the same thing seeks to build the world with his Gospel or otherwise it makes it only with your reason.
we know that with Jesus life becomes too much more full and withH it becomes easier to find the sense of every thing.
it is therefore that we evangelize.
the true missionary, who never ceases to be a disciple, knows that Jesus is going with him, speaks with him, takes the breath with him, works with him.
feel Jesus alive with him heart the missionary work.
if one does not discover it present at the same core of his missionary commitment, it will soon lose the hedge and no longer be sure of what he is seeking to pass, reduce health and passion.
and a person who is not convinced, encouraged, assured, inhuman, unconvincing someone.
united with Jesus, we seek what he seeks, love what he loves.
Finally, what we are looking for is the glory of the Father, who live and act "for the praise of the glory of his grace" (Efes 1: 6).
if we want to support ourselves and always, we need to go there from any other motivation.
this is the final motivation, most profound, the reason and ultimate sense of doing.
it is the glory of the Father, that Jesus searched throughout his life.
he is the Son who wait forever with all that is "within the Father" (Jn 1: 18).
if we missionaries, this is foremost because Jesus said to us: "This is the glory of Father, which you make many fruit" (John 15: 8).
there is from whether we earn or not, do not interfere with or not, serve or not, there are from the small limits of our wishes, what we can understand and our motivations, we evangelize for the greatest glory of the Father loving us.
spiritual fun that we are people
the word of God also invited us to recognise that we are people: "I have once not been a people, now I have heard the people of God" (1 Pt 2: 10).
in order to avoid authentic evangeliisers we also need to develop the spiritual fun that remain close to people' s lives, provided that we discover that this becomes a source of higher joy.
the mission is a passion for Jesus but, at the same time, is a passion for his people.
when we were brought to Jesus at the Curia, we recognise all his love to give us a dignity and our storage, but, at that same time, if we are not blind, we will understand that that look of Jesus is broadened and rotated by love and a desire for all his people.
so we rediscover that He must be read with us to arrive ever closer to his loved people.
we come from among the people and send us to the people, so that our identity cannot understand it without this belonging.
Jesus himself is the model of this choice of evangelization that we put us in the heart of the people.
how much do we want to see it close to everyone!
if he had greeted someone, he was looking at his eyes with great attention to love: "Jesus has taken him a look of love" (Mk 10: 21).
we see it open to meet others when they move close to the place with the side of the road (see Mk 10: 46 - 52) and when you eat and drink with the sinners (see Mk 2: 16), without taking into account the wikedness and sacrances (see Mt 11: 19).
we see it available when leaving one woman to fly his feet with oil (see Lk 7: 36 - 50) and when he receives night to Nikodemu (see Jn 3: 1 - 15).
when Jesus is given on the cross, this is not other than the core of this style which marked all his life.
I pray from this model, we must enter into the heart of society, share life with all, listen to their concerns, helping them materially and spiritually in their needs, congratulate with those who fears and strive in building a new world, shoulder with others.
but this does not do so like it was an obligation, like it was a burden to shiny us, but as a personal choice that shapes us with joy and gives us an identity.
sometimes we feel the temptation to be Christian to keep a prudent distance from the rest of the Lord.
but Jesus wants to touch the human misery, which touch the suffering body of others.
he expects us not to seek those dead of personal or community shelter who keeps us away from the heart of human suffering, so we can truly accept entering into contact with the concrete existence of others and recognise the strongness of sweetness.
when we do so, life always complicates itself nicely and we live the strong experience of people, the experience we do part of a people.
it is true that, in our relationship with the world, we are invited to give reason for our hope, but not as enemies that punish them and condemn.
the warning is clear: "respond with sweetness and respect" (1 Pt 3: 16), and "if possible, provided that they come from you, live in peace with all" (Rom 12: 18).
we have also warned of seeking "good evil" (Rom 12: 21), without promising ever to do wealth "(Gal 6: 9) and without claiming to be superior but taking into account" the other best of us "(Fil 2: 3).
in fact to the Apostles of the Lord "all the people had brought them" (Acts 2: 47; see 4: 2133; 5: 13).
it remains clear that Jesus Christ does not want to be such as hirery - looking principles, but like men and women of the people.
this is not the Pope' s view, nor any pastoral choice among many others that are all possible; they are indications of God' s Word so clear, direct and evident that they do not need interpretations that can be able to deviate them from their power to challenge us.
we will live them "sine glossa," without commentary.
so we have created the missionary joy that we share our lives with the people of God by seeking to relieve fire in the heart of the world.
love for people is a spiritual power leading to the full meeting with God, so that those who do not love his brother "goes in darkness" (1 Jn 2: 11), "is in death" (1 Jn 3: 14) and "do not know God" (1 Jn 4: 8).
every time we met with another man in love, we will put ourselves in a position to discover something new about God.
every time we open our eyes to recognise the other person, turn too much more to our faith to recognise God.
as a consequence, if we want to grow in spiritual life, we cannot be missionaries.
the commitment of evangelization gives me the mind and heart, we hear us for spiritual horizons, make us more sensible to recognise the action of the Spirit, out of our limited spiritual schemes.
at the same time, a mission that is fully dedicated to its work, can enjoy the fun of becoming a water source, leaking and training to others.
it can only be a missionary who feel well looking for the good of the proxxm, who wishes the joy of others.
this openness is a source of hena, because "the one who gives is more of the one who takes" (Acts 20: 35).
we don' t be better if we are fleeing others, we hide, remain back from sharing with others, we will resist to give, close to our comfort.
this is not except suicide slowly.
the mission that I can be at the heart of the people is not part of my life, or we will be able to fear, is not an appendent, or a very heart moment in my life.
it is something that I can' t predict from what I am if I don' t want to destroy me.
I am a mission on this ground, so I am in this world.
we want to see ourselves as marked by fire from this mission that we surround, inbieric, thrown, open, hunger.
there appears the nurse who has a soul, the teacher who has a soul, the politicians who have a soul, those who decided in their heart that are with others and others.
however, if one rejects his duty on the one hand and his private life on the other, everything is transformed into a grey and starts all the time seeks the smoothness and defends its needs.
it is no longer a people' s lives.
we can share our lives with people and engage with generosity, we also need to recognise that every person deserves our attention.
not because of its physical appearance, its skills, language, mentality or satisfaction that you can offer us, but because it is an opera of God, his creature.
he left her nets, and she reflects something from his glory.
every man is an object of the unfounded sweetness of the Lord, and he himself binds in his life.
for that person, Jesus Christ destroyed his precious blood on the cross.
there is from every appearance, every person is immenseely holy and imagine our love and attention.
therefore, if I succeeded in helping a single person to live better, this is already sufficient to justify the donation of life.
how beautiful it is that we are the people of God' s faith.
and come to the mile when you burn the walls and let us be filled with surfaces and names!
in the second chapter we reflected on that lack of profound spirituality that is changed into the pessic, fatalism, in the hospital.
some are not given to the mission because they believe that there is nothing to change and therefore for them we will stay to make efforts.
do you think this: "What do I have to be deprived of my commodities and pleasure if I do not see any important outcome?"
with this mentality it is impossible to be missionaries.
this conduct is well a bad excuse to remain closed in comfort, joy, in the sadness never to find satisfaction free, in the egoist empty.
we have a behaviour that destroys the person itself, because "man cannot live without hope: his life, condemned that he does not understand, become unsustainable." [211] If we think that things are not up to change ever, we remember that Jesus Christ wins on sin and death and is strongly filled and power.
Jesus Christ lives truly.
otherwise, "if Christ does not have raised death, he is our prediocation" (1 Cor 15: 14).
the Gospel tells us that when the first disciples left to persuade, "the Lord was working with them and performs the Word" (Mk 16: 20).
this is also done today.
we are invited to discover it, live it.
Christ Rxoxt and glory is the strong eye of our hope, and it is not up to our help to carry out the mission that He knows us in our hands.
his resurrection is not a thing of the past; it contains a power of life that has entered and spread to the world.
where we don' t seem everything dead, return from anywhere the shoots of the resurrection.
it is a power that there is no such as it.
it is true that God is often seen as God does not exist: we see around us injustice, e. g. indifferences and unsuccessful cefry.
but so another is sure that this hope always begins to spread something new, which today or tomorrow will make fruit.
in all desire you to redouble life, stinated and never smell.
so there are many coroh things, but the right always return to steam and spread.
every day in our world is rebuild beauty, which resembles from heart the turmoil of history.
the values always appear again in new forms, and in fact human beings are often re - born from shocks which appear not to be returned.
this is the power of resurrection and any evangelizer is a tool of this dynamism.
all times new difficulties arise, bankruptcy experience, harmful human weaknesses.
from all experience we know that there is sometimes a work that does not give satisfaction that we wish us, the fruit will be scars and slow changes, and one knows the temptation to defeat and drink.
however, when one, because of tiredness, lowers for a few hands, not the same as when they were completely forgotten because it is felt from a lack of happiness that has not been healing, from certain soul- dried spices.
it can happen that the heart is third because ultimately looking for itself in a carrerism for securitisations, Clauses, prizes, posts; here is no less than his hands, but do not swallow a grink, reduce the rise.
so, the Gospel, which is the best message here in the world, remains buried under many excuse.
the faith also means believing inH, we believe that we really love us, who is alive, who has the ability to enter mysterious manner in our life, that we do not leave alone, which, by his power and with his unfounded creativity, from the wrong knows the right.
we believe that He is still not a winner in history together with "those with whom he is called and chosen and faithful" (Apok 17: 14).
it is present, it comes again, strive to revitalise.
the resurrection of Christ joins everywhere the roots of this new world; and even if they are cut, they will be re - evident, because the Lord' s resurrection has already entered the hidden issue of this history, because Jesus did not have raised somewhat of the dead.
let' s no longer remain with the side of this journey of hope!
as we do not always see these roots, we need certainty that comes from inside, that is to say that God can act in any circumstances, even heart those who are outside appear failures, because "this treasury is having in the gard of the wheez" (2 Cor 4: 7).
this certainty is what is called "a sense of mystery."
it means that we know with certainty that the offeror himself and is given to God with love, sure to make fruit (see Jn 15: 15).
this fruit often does not appear, it cannot touch with your hands, cannot count.
one knows well that his life will give fruit, but without claiming that he knows how, or where, or when.
it has the certainty that none of the tasks it performs love is not to be lost, nothing will be lost from its genuine concern for others, it will not be lost from his love crops to God, nothing will be lost from the generous work, nothing will be lost from the finding that it is not lacking pain.
all this turns to our world as a power to give life.
sometimes we think that with our efforts we have not achieved any outcome, but the mission is not any agreement or piece of business, nor is a humanitarian organisation, is not an spectacle to pass on how many people took part thanks to our propaganda; it is too profound, which can not be measured in no way.
perhaps the Lord is being killed with our commitment to disseminate his barks on any other place in the world where we never have to lose.
the Holy Spirit works as he wants, when he wants and where he wants; we strive with dedication but without reiterating that we can see results that give in the eye.
we only know that our gift is needed.
we learn to rest within the sweetness of the Father in our creative and generous grant.
we move forward, enter into us with our soul and our body, but let us make us a form of waste in our efforts as he thinks He.
to keep the missionary we need full trust in the Holy Spirit, so that He "helps us in the absence of our capacity" (Rom 8: 26).
but such generous trust needs to be strengthened and therefore we need to call it at every time.
he can cure us from all that we keep us back in our missionary commitment.
it is true that this faith in what you do not seem to have a little of the oil: this is when you are seemed at sea where you don' t know what it has to meet.
I' m themselves this thing kill it how many times.
however, there is no better freedom than leaving the Spirit to take us where he wants Hu, and we don' t stop measuring or control everything, and let us illuminate us, lead us, to take us where he wishes Hu.
he knows good what is needed at every time and at any time.
this means that we are mysterious form!
missionary power of the intercession
there is a form of prayer which is particularly strong in our efforts to evangelization and motivate us to seek the wealth of others: the intercession.
for one while let us observe what he had in it contains great evangelizer such as St Paul, to understand how he was his prayer.
this prayer was filled with people: "I always pray in my prayer for you [...] because I get you in my heart" (At 1: 4,7).
so we know that when I intercede, we are not selling from the true contemplation, because the contemplation that keeps outside others is destroyed.
this attitude is changed even in thanks to God for others: "It is forbidden to God through Jesus Christ, because your faith will end it throughout the world" (Rom 1: 8).
this means the continuous thanks: "I have always forgotten my God because of you for the grace that God gave you, to you in Christ Jesus" (1 Cor 1: 4); "I pray my God whenever I remember you" (On 1: 3).
it is not a faithful, negative and hopeless look, but a spiritual look, of strong faith, to recognise what God itself is performing in them.
at the same time, it is the gratitude to come from a very careful heart to others.
in this way, when evangelizer comes from a life of prayer, he said would be more generous, feel released from isolated conscience and driving that makes the right and share his life with others.
the great men and women of God were major interruptions.
the intercession is like "yeast" within Trinity.
we enter the heart of the Father and discover dimensions that light light on concrete situations and change them.
we can say that God' s heart is raised before the intercession, but in reality He always arrives before us, and what we can do we with our intercession is that his strongness, love and loyalty appear more clearly in the people.
Mary, Mother evangelization
together with the Holy Spirit, the heart of the people there is always Mary.
she was gathering around it to the disciples to call his power (Acts 1: 14), making it possible that missionary explosion that took place on Thursday.
she Mother the Church that evangelizes and without it we cannot fully understand the spirit of the new evangelization.
the gift of Jesus to his people
on the cross, while Christ was suffering in his own day the dramatic meeting between the sins of the world and God' s mercy, he could be visiting him all the presence of the Mother and the disciples of loved.
at that time, before he stated with his signature the work that the Father was left in his hands, Jesus said to Mary: "Mara, here is your son."
then he said to the disciples the loved: "So is your mother" (Jn 19: 26 - 27).
these words of Jesus on the core of death first of all do not express any mercy concerns for his mother, but rather they are a revelation formula that confers the mystery of a special faith mission.
Jesus left us his mother to be our mother.
it was only after he did so that Jesus could feel that "everything is mymum" (Jn 19: 30).
in the legs of the cross, in the most hours of the new creation, Christ sends us to Mary.
we send us to us because we do not want to move without mother, and the people in that image of a mother read all the mysteries of the Gospel.
the Lord does not want his Church to be lacking female icon.
it is, that I am very faithful, also joins "with the rest of her Son, with those who protect God' s precipes and who have witness to Jesus" (Apok 12: 17).
Mary is what for the animals you know him at home for Jesus, with little bands and many sweeten.
it is the tiny servants of the Father exceeding joy in the pray.
it is that partner always attending not to reduce wine in our life.
it is that with her heart who lost the findings, which can understand all our pain.
as a mother of all, it is a sign of hope for the nations suffering payment pain until the time you graduate justice.
it is the missionary that approaches us to join us in our lives, and with her love of a mother confers us a heart for faith.
as a true mother, goes with us, third us, and xxerred without stopping God' s love that is close to our close.
through the number of Marian devotions, generally related to the sanctuaries, share in all of the people who received the Gospel, and forms part of his historical identity.
many Christian parents claim the Baptism for their children in a marian sanctuary, and so deserve to the faith of the maternal action of Mary which has created new children to God.
there are, in the sanctuaries, we can see how Mary collects around her children who, bred up with so many holes, come pilgrimes to see it and feel silent on them.
there find God' s power to suffer the suffering and fatigue of life.
how did St Juan Diego, Mary offer them the ability of her mother' s brothers and sisters, and tell them: "Do you leave your heart shake [...] I don' t here, your Mother?" [213]
the new evangelization kewk
to this Mother of the Gospel we pray it to enter us to welcome this invitation to a new evangelization cap by the ecclesial community as a whole.
it is the woman of faith, which goes in faith, [214] and "the journey of its faith, a truly exceptional journey, is a journey to which it wants to look to know is not well the Church." [215] I left the Spirit to lead it, along a pilgrimage of faith, to a service destiny and beauty life.
but it is not hard in this beginning you see particular holes and fatigue of the heart, together with an 'night of faith' - to use a phrase of St John of the Cross - like a' veil' from which you want to move to what does not appear and live in life you are with mystery.
he propelled in this way that Mary, for many years, lived life you hope with the mystery of her Son, and did not walk her faith. "[217]
the work of evangelization carried out by the Church has a Marian style.
for every time we look at Mary, we are believing in the revolutionary power of the sweetness and love.
we see how humility and sweetness are not weak but of those who are strong, who do not need to deal wrongly to others to feel important.
we look at it and write that the one who has seized God because "we download us from their throne" and "the rich sent them out for free" (Lk 1: 53,53) is the same to see that there is that family encouraged in our search of justice.
it is even what we buried in her heart "all these things and think about them between it and between itself" (Lk 2: 19).
Mary knows the steps of the Spirit of God in the great events and even in those that appear as visible.
I contemplate God' s mystery in the world, history and daily life of every person and everyone.
she is the woman asking and working in Nazareth, and she is also our Mother of the sock, what leaves her village to "accelerate" (Lk 1: 39) helps others.
it is this dynamics of justice and sweetness, contemplation and moving to others, which makes it a model for the Church in its evangelization.
we pray that with her prayer of a mother helps us to become a house for many, mother for all nations, making it possible to birth a new world.
he said to us, with a power to fill with confidence which is like it and a strong hope: "See, we will renew everything" (Apok 21: 5).
with Mary we move our trust towards this promise, and tell it:
throw the Verb of life
at the bottom of your humble faith,
[44] San Tumas of Aquino had stressed that multiplicity and distinction "derives from the intention of the primary agent," he wanted that "what nothing should do in it to represent divine tjieba," for the other, "for the glory of Creator" cannot be properly represented by one creature "(summa Theologiæ I, q. 47, Art. 1).
it is therefore necessary to understand the variety of things in the number of relations between them (see Summa Theologiæ.

due to the large number of topics that were treated by Pope Francis in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium, several requests have been made by members of the Church in Malta and Gozo to draw up a detailed index of these themes.
the index helps prepare a talk, homily or writing.
it also helps you in personal reflection, and to link the pastoral proposals contained in the Exhortation with our life as members of the Church and society.

Strip ye the wicked of all power! 2
Hum2 90 (xCayamnem aCavanem dAyata axCayamnem drva # tem): "cause You the truthful one to be in control (of himself), the Deceitful one not to be in control (of himself)"
absolute in power may the holy be, bereft of all free choice the wicked!
gone (May he BE), met as foe, carried out from the Creatures of Spenta Mainyu, thereed in without power over any wish!
I will incite, even I who am Zarathushtra, the heads of the houses, villages, Zantus, and provinces, to the careful following of this Religion which is that of Ahura, and according to Zarathushtra, in their thoughts, their words, and their deeds. 3
Hum2 183 (haxCaya.. fratem &.. ai * h @ da% Nay @ anumataya% ja anuxtaya% ja anuvarctaya% ja): "I would spur on the authorities.. to follow this religion with thoughts, word, and actions"
I Pray for the freedom and glory of the entire existence of the holy (MAN) while I bless it, and I Pray for the repression and shame of the entire existence of the wicked.
Ashem Vohu.. (3).
Propitiation to Haoma who brings righteousness (to US) for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and for praise.
(the Zaotar?) As the AHU to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar speaks out to me.
(the Ratu.) As an AHU to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar speaks forth to me.
(the Zaotar.) So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned, speak out!
the HOM YASHT
at the hour of Havani, Haoma came to Zarathushtra, as he served the (sacred) Fire, and sanctified (its flame), while he sang aloud the Gathas.
and Zarathushtra asked him: Who art thou, O Honorable one1!
who art of all the incarnate world the most beautiful in thine own body of those whom I have, seen, (thou) Glorious [immortal]?
so Hum2 138; Mills has 'O with'.
thereupon gave Haoma answer, the holy one who driveth death afar: I am, O Zarathushtra Haoma, the holy and driving death afar; Pray to me, O Spitama, prepare me for the taste.
praise me so that also the other Saoshyants [benefactors] may praise me2.
so Hum2 74.
Mills reads.
'praise toward me in (thy) praises as the other [Saoshyants] praise.'
thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Unto Haoma be the praise.
what man, O Haoma!
first prepared thee for the Corporeal world?
what award3 was offered him?
what gain did he acquire?
(ashish) Mills relates Ashi to Asha and reads 'blessedness'.
thereupon did Haoma answer me, he the holy one, and driving death afar: Vivanghvant was the first of men who prepared me for the incarnate world.
this award4 was offered Him; this gain did he acquire, that to him was born a son who was Yima, called the brilliant, (HE of the many Flocks, the most Glorious of those yet born, the sunlike - one of men), that he made from his authority both herds and people free from dying, both plants and waters free from drought, and men could eat inexhaustible5 food.
in the reign of brave6 Yima was there neither cold nor heat, there was neither age nor death, nor envy demon- made.
like teenagers7 walked the two forth, son and father, in their stature and their form, so long as Yima, son of Vivanghvant ruled, he of the many herds!
who was the second man, O Haoma!
who prepared thee for the Corporeal world?
what award8 was offered him?
what gain did he acquire?
Mills: 'sanctity'.
thereupon gave Haoma answer, he the holy one, and driving death afar: Athwya was the second who prepared - me for the Corporeal world.
this award9 was given him, this gain did he acquire, that to him a son was born, Thraetaona of the mighty clan10,
who smote Azhi Dahaka11, three - Jawed and triple - headed, six- eyed, with thousand perceptions12, and of mighty strength, a lie - demon [druj] of the Daevas, evil for our settlements, and wicked, which the evil spirit Angra Mainyu made as the most mighty Druj [against the Corporeal world], and for the murder of (our) settlements, and to slay the (homes) of Asha!
who was the third man, O Haoma!
who prepared thee for the Corporeal world?
what award13 was given him?
what gain did he acquire?
Mills: 'blessedness'.
thereupon gave Haoma answer, the holy one, and driving death afar: Thrita, [the most helpful of the Samids], was the third man who prepared me for the Corporeal world.
this award was given him, this gain did he acquire, that to him two son were born, Urvakhsoftya and Keresaspa, the one a judge confirming order, the other a youth of great ascendant, curly - haired14, bluedgeon - bearing.
he who smote the horny dragon swallowing men, and swallowing horses, poisonous, and green of color over which, as thick as thumbs are, greenish poison flowed aside, on whose back once Keresaspa cooked his meat in iron caldron at the noonday meal; and the acknowledgedly, scorched, upstarted, and springing off, dashed out the water as it Boiled.
headlong fled affrighted manly minded Keresaspa.
who was the fourth man who prepared thee, O Haoma!
for the Corporeal world?
what blessedness was given him?
what gain did he acquire?
thereupon gave Haoma answer, he the Holy, and driving death afar: Pourushaspa was the fourth man who prepared me for the Corporeal world.
this blessedness was given him, this gain did he acquire, that thou, O Zarathushtra!
wast born to him, the just, in Pourushaspa' s house, the Daeva' s foe, the friend of Mazda' s Lore, (14) famous in Airyana Vaejah; and thou, O Zarathushtra!
didst recite the first the Ahuna - vairya, four times intoning it, and with verses kept apart [(Pazand) each time with louder and still louder voice].
and thou didst cause, O Zarathushtra!
all the demon- gods to vanish in the ground who asofttime flew about this earth in human form (and power.
this hast thou done), thou who hast been the strongest, and the staunchest, the most active, and the swiftest, and (in every deed) the most victorious in the two spirits' world.
thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma.
good is Haoma, and the well- endowed, exact and righteous in its nature, and good inherently, and Healing, beautiful of form, and good in deed, and most successful in its working, golden- hued, with bending sprouts.
as it is the best for drinking, so (through its Sacred stimulus) is it the most nutritious for the soul.
I make my claim on thee, O yellow one!
for inspiration.
I make my claim on thee for strength; I make my claim on thee for victory; I make my claim on thee for health and Healing (when Healing is my need); I make my claim on thee for progress and increased prosperity, and vigor of the entire Frame, and for understanding, of each admissibility kind, and for this, that I may have free course among our settlements, having power where I will, overwhelming angry malice, and a Conqueror of lies.
YEA, I make my claim on thee that I may overhelm the angry hate of haters, of the Daevas and of mortals, of the sorcerers and Sirens, of the Tyrants, and the Kavis, of the Karpans, murderous bipeds, of the sanctity - destroyers, the PROFANE apostate bipeds, of the Wolves four- footed monsters, of the invading host, wide - fronted, which with stratagems advance.
this first blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest death afar!
I beseech of thee for (heaven), the best life of the saints, the Radiant, all- Glorious.
this second blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest death afar!
this body' s health (before that blest life is attained).
this third blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest death afar!
the long vitality of life.
this fourth blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest death afar!
that I may stand out on this earth with desires gained, and powerful, receiving satisfaction, overhelming the assaults of hate, and conquering the lie.
this fifth blessing, O Haoma, I beseech of thee, thou that drivest death afar!
that I may stand victorious on earth, conquering in battles, overhelming the assaults of hate, and conquering the lie.
this sixth blessing I ask of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest death afar!
that we may get good warning of the thief, good warning of the murderer, see first the bluedgeon - bearer, get first sight of the Wolf.
may no one whichsoever get first the sight of us.
in the strife with each may we be they who get the first alarm!
Haoma grants to racers who would run a course with span both speed and bottom (in their horses).
Haoma grants to women come to bed with child a brilliant offspring and a righteous line.
Haoma grants to those (How many!) who have long sat searching books, more knowledge and more wisdom.
Haoma grants to those long maidens, who sit at home unwed, good husbands, and that as soon as asked, he Haoma, the well- minded.
Haoma lowered Keresani, dethroned him from his Throne, for he grew so fond of power, that he treacherously said: No priest behind (and watching) shall walk the land for me, as a counselor to prosper them, he would rob everything of progress, he would crush the growth of all!
Hail to thee, O Haoma, who hast power as thou wilt, and by thine inborn strength!
Hail to thee, thou art well- versed in many sayings, and true and holy words.
Hail to thee for thou dost ask no wily questions, but questionest direct.
forth hath Mazda borne to thee, the star- bespangled girdle, the spirit- made, the Ancient one, the Mazdayasnian faith.
so with this thou art begirt on the summits of the Mountains, for the spreading of the precepts, and the headings of the Mathra, (and to help the Mathra' s teacher),
o Haoma, thou house - lord, and thou clan- lord, thou tribe - lord, and Chieftain of the land, and thou successful learned teacher, for aggressive strength I speak to thee, for that which smites with Victory, and for my body' s saving, and for manifold delight!
bear off from us the torment and the malice of the hateful.
divert the angry foe' s intent!
what man soever in this house is violent and wicked, what man soever in this village, or this tribe, or province, seize thou away the fleetness from his feet; throw thou a Veil of darkness O' er his mind; make thou his intellectualect (at once) a wreck!
let not the man who harms us, mind or body, have power to go forth on both his legs, or hold with both his hands, or see with both his eyes, not the land (Beneath his feet), or the herd before his face.
at the aroused and fearful Dragon, green, and belching forth his poison, for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!
at the (murderous) bluedgeon - bearer, committing deeds unheard of, blood- thirsty, (drunk) with Fury, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!
against the wicked human Tyrant, Hurling weapons at the head, for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!
against the righteousness - disturber, the unholy life - Destroyer, thoughts and words of our religion well- delivering, yet in actions never reaching, for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!
against the body of the harlot, with her magic minds O' erthrowing with (intoxicating) pleasures, to the lusts her person offering, whose mind as ship wavers as it flies before the wind, for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!
let the Demon- gods and goddesses fly far away from hence, and let the good Sraosha make here his Home!
[and may the good Blessedness here likewise dwell], and may she here spread delight and peace within this house, Ahura' s, which is sanctified by Haoma, bringing righteousness (to ALL).
at the first force of thy pressure, O intelligent!
I praise thee with my voice, while I grasp at first thy shoots.
at thy next pressure, O intelligent!
I praise thee with my voice, when as with full force of a man I crush thee down.
I praise the cloud that waters thee, and the rains which make thee grow on the summits of the mountains; and I praise thy lofty M Dogs where the Haoma branches spread.
this wide earth do I praise, expanded far (with paths), the productive, the full bearing, thy mother, holy plant!
YEA, I praise the land where thou dost grow, sweet- scented, quickly spreading, the good growth of the Lord.
o Haoma, thou growest on the Mountains, apart on many paths, and there still may' st thou flourish.
the springs of Righteousness most verily thou art, (and the fountains of the Ritual find their source in thee)!
grow (then) because I Pray to thee on all thy stems and branches, in all thy shoots (and tendrils) increase thou through my word!
Haoma grows while he is praised, and the man who praises him is therewith more victorious.
the lightest pressure of thee, Haoma, thy feeblest praise, the slightest tasting of thy juice, avails to the thousand - smiting of the Daevas.
Wasting doth vanish from that house, and- with it foulness, whither in Verity they bear thee, and where thy praise in truth is Sung, the drink of Haoma, famed, health - bringing (as thou art).
[(Pazand) to his village and abode they bear him.]
all other toxicants go hand in hand with Rapine of the bloody spear, but Haoma' s stirring power goes hand in hand with Friendship.
[light is the drunkenness of Haoma (Pazand).] Who as a tender son caresses Haoma, forth to the bodies of such persons Haoma comes to Heal.
of all the Healing virtues, Haoma, whereby thou art a healer, grant me some.
of all the victorious powers, whereby thou art a victor, grant me some.
a faithful praiser will I be to thee, O Haoma, and a faithful praiser (is) a better (thing) than Righteousness the Best; so hath the Lord, declaring (IT), Zened.
SWIFT and wise hath the well- skilled Deity created thee; swift and wise on high Haraiti did He, the well- skilled, plant thee.
and taught (by implanted instinct) on every side, the bounteous birds have carried thee to the Peaks- above - the - Eagles, to the mount' s extremest summit, to the gorges and abysses, to the Heights of many pathways, to the snow - peaks ever whitened.
there, Haoma, on the ranges dost thou grow of many kinds.
now thou growest of Milky whiteness, and now thou growest golden; and forth thine Healing liquors flow for the inspiring of the pious.
so terrify away from me the (death' s) aim of the curser.
so terrify and crush his thought who stands as my maligner.
praise be to thee, O Haoma, (for he makes the poor man' s thoughts as great as any of the richest whomsoever.) Praise be to Haoma, (for he makes the poor with s thoughts as great as when mind reacheth culmination.) With manifold retainers dost thou, O Haoma, endow the man who drinks thee mixed with milk; YEA, more prosperous thou makest him, and more endowed with mind.
do not vanish from me suddenly like milk - drops in the rain; let thine exhilarations go forth ever vigorous and fresh; and let them come to me with strong effect.
before thee, holy Haoma, thou bearer of the Ritual Truth, and around thee would I cast this body, a body which (as all) may see (is fit for gift and) grown.
I renounce with vehemence the murderous woman' s emptiness, the Jaini' s, hers, with intellectualect dethroned.
she vainly thinks to foil us, and would beguile both Fire - priest and Haoma; but she herself, deceived therein, shall perish.
and when she sits at home, and wrongly eats of Haoma' s offering, priest' s mother will that never make her, nor give her holy sons!
to five do I belong, to five others do I not; of the good thought am I, of the evil am I not; of the good word am I, of the evil am I not; of the good deed am I, and of the evil, not.
to obedience am I given, and to Deaf disobedience, not; to the saint do I belong, and to the wicked, not; and so from this on till the ending shall be the spirits' Parting.
(the two shall here divide.)
thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma, Mazda - made.
good is Haoma, Mazda - made.
all the plants of Haoma praise I, on the Heights of lofty Mountains, in the gorges of the valleys, in the clefts (of sundered hill- sides) cut for the bundles bound by women.
from the silver cup I pour Thee to the golden chalice over.
let me not thy (sacred) Liquor spill to earth, of precious cost.
these are thy Gathas, holy Haoma, these thy Songs, and these thy teachings, and these thy truthful Ritual words, health - impartiting, victory - giving, from harmful hatred Healing giving.
these and thou art Mine, and forth let thine exhilarations flow; bright and sparkling let them hold on their (steadfast) way; for light are thine exhilaration (s), and flying lightly come they here.
Victory - giving smiteth Haoma, victory - giving is it worshipped; with this Gathic word we praise it.
praise to the Kine; praise and victory (BE) spoken to Her!
food for the kine, and pasture!
'for the kine let thrift use toil; yield thou us food. "
we worship the yellow lofty one; we worship Haoma who causes progress, who makes the settlements advance; we worship Haoma who drives death afar; YEA, we worship all the Haoma plants.
and we worship (their) blessedness, and the Fravashi of Zarathushtra Spitama, the saint.
Prelude TO THE HAOMA - offering.
three clean Creatures (full of blessings) curse besoft while yet invoking, the cow, the horse, and then Haoma.
the cow cries to her driver thus: Childless be thou, shorn of offspring evil- famed, and slander - followed, who foddered fairly dost not use me, but fattenest me for wife or children, and for thy n Rusard selfish meal.
the horse cries to his rider thus: Be not spanner of the racers; stretch no coursers to full- speed; do not STRIDE across the fleetest, thou, who dost not Pray me swiftness in the meeting thick with numbers, in the circuit thollowed with men.
Haoma speaks his quesker thus: Childless be thou, shorn of offspring, evil- famed, and slander - followed, who holdest me from full outpouring, as a robber, skulls in- crushing.
No head- smiter am I ever, holy Haoma, far from death.
forth my father gave an offering, tongue and left eye chose Ahura, set apart for Haoma' s meal.
who this offers would deny me, eats himself, or prays it from me, this which Mazda gave to bless me, tongue with left eye (as my portion).
in his house is born no fire - priest, Warrior ne' er in chariot standing, never more the thrifty tiller.
in his home be born Dahakas, Murakas of evil practice, doing deeds of double nature.
Quick, cut off then Haoma' s portion, gift of flesh for Doughty Haoma!
heed ready Haoma bind thee opened, as he bound the fell Turanian Frangrasyan (the murderous robber) fast in iron close - surrounded in the mid- third of this earth!
thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma made by Mazda, good is Haoma Mazda - made.
who to us is one hereupon to thee (becomes) two, to be made to three, for the five - making of the four, for the seven- making of the sixth, who are your nine in the decade (?), who survey you and with zeal.
to thee, O holy Haoma!
bearer of the Ritual sanctity, I offer this my person which is seen (by all to be) mature, (and fit for gift); to Haoma the effective do I offer it, and to the Sacred exhilaration which he bestows; and do thou grant to me (for this), O holy Haoma!
thou that drivest death afar, (Heaven) the best world of the saints, shining, all Brilliant.
(the Ashem Vohu, & c.)
May' st Thou rule at thy will, O Lord.. (Repeat y8. 5 - 7)!
I confess myself a Mazdayasnian of Zarathushtra' s order.
I Celebrate my praises for good thoughts, good words, and good deeds for my thoughts, my speeches, and (MY) actions.
with chanting praises I present all good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and with rejection I repudiate all evil thoughts, and words, and deeds. 18.
here I give to you, O ye bountiful Immortals!
sacrifice and homage with the mind, with words, deeds, and my entire person; YEA, (I offer) to you the flesh of my very body (as your own).
and I praise Righteousness.
a blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best, & c.
the Zoroastrian Creed.
this Creed probably dates to the earliest days of the faith, but seems to have undergone some linguistic shift and subsequent recasting in the Old Avestan Dialect.
it was probably intended to be recited before an open assembly.
see discussion in Boyce, Zoroastrianism - Its Antiquity and Constant Vigour, (Costa mesa, Mazda Pub, 1992, p. 84 and 104 ff).
the last phrase of verse 7, plus all of verses 8 and 9, are incorporated into the daily Kusti Ritual.
I curse the Daevas.
I declare myself a Mazda - worshlete, a supporter of Zarathushtra, hostile to the Daevas, fond of Ahura' s teaching, a praiser of the Amesha Spentas, a worshlete of the Amesha Spentas.
I as contributione all good to Ahura Mazda, 'and all the best,' Asha - endowed, Splendid, xwarena - endowed, whose is the cow, whose is Asha, whose is the light, 'may whose blissful areas be filled with light'.
I choose the good Spenta Armaiti for myself; let her be Mine.
I renounce theft and robbery of the cow, and the damaging and planning of the Mazdayasnian settlements.
I want freedom of movement and freedom of dwelling for those with homesteads, to those who dwell upon this earth with their cattle.
with reverence for Asha, and (offerings) offered up, I vow this: I shall never damage or plunder the Mazdayasnian settlements, even if I have to risk life and limb.
I reject the authority of the Daevas, the wicked, no - good, lawless, evil- knowing, the most druj - like of beings, the foulest of beings, the most damaging of beings.
I reject the Daevas and their comrades, I reject the demons (yatu) and their comrades; I reject any who harm beings.
I reject them with my thoughts, words, and deeds.
I reject them publicly.
even as I reject the head (authorities), so too do I reject the hostile followers of the druj.
as Ahura Mazda taught Zarathushtra at all discussions, at all meetings, at which Mazda and Zarathushtra conversed;
6. as Ahura Mazda taught Zarathushtra at all discussions, at all meetings, at which Mazda and Zarathushtra conversed - even as Zarathushtra rejected the authority of the Daevas, so I also reject, as Mazda - worshrastim and supporter of Zarathushtra, the authority of the Daevas, even as He, the Asha - endowed Zarathushtra, has rejected them.
I profess myself a Mazda - worshlete, a Zoroastrian, having vowed it and professed it.
I pledge myself to the well- thought thought, I pledge myself to the well- spoken word, I pledge myself to the well- done action.
I pledge myself to the Mazdayasnian religion, which causes the attack to be put off and weapons put down; [which upholds khvaetvadatha], Asha - endowed; which of all religiousions that exist or shall be, is the greatest, the best, and the most beautiful: Ahuric, Zoroastrian.
I ascribe all good to Ahura Mazda.
this is the Creed of the Mazdayasnian religion.

thus the two spirits thought, thus they spoke, and thus they did;
and therefore as thou, O Ahura Mazda!
didst think, speak, dispose, and do all things good (for US), so to Thee would we give, so would we assign to Thee our homage; so would we worship Thee with our sacrifices.
so would we bow before Thee with these gifts, and so direct our Prayers to Thee with confessions of our debt.

a blessing is the right called the best..
we worship the Ahuna - vairya; and we worship Asha Vahishta the best (?), the bountiful immortal.
and we sacrifice to the Ha fraoreti, even to the confession and laudation of the Mazdayasnian Faith!
DEDsoft.

and to You, O Ye bountiful Immortals!
would I delegate the flesh of my very body, and all the Blessings of a prospered life.
in this Zaothra with this Baresman, I desire to approach the holy Yazads with my praise, and all the holy lords of the Ritual order at their times, Havani at his time, and Savanghi and Visya at their times. 4.
I confess myself a Mazdayasnian, and of Zarathushtra' s order.
the Zaotar Speaks: As an AHU (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar (?) speaks out to me (?).
the Ratu Speaks: As an AHU (revered and) to be chosen, the Zaotar speaks forth to me.
the Zaotar: So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned, speak out!
the sacrifice continues.
with PRECEPT, praise, and with delight produced by grace, I call upon the bountiful Immortals the good, and also therewith the beautiful by name; and I sacrifice to them with the blessing of the good Ritual, with the earnest Blessings of the good Mazdayasnian faith.
whose best gift from his Righteousness is mine in the offering Ahura this knoweth; who have lived, and live ever, by their names these I worship, while I draw near with praises.
the Good Kingdom is to be chosen, that lot which most of all bears on (our blessings).
let Sraosha (Obedience) be here present for the sacrifice of Ahura Mazda, the most benefitent, the Holy, who is so dear to us as at the first, so at the last; YEA, let him be present here.
as the AHU (revered and) to be chosen, the Atarevakhsoft thus speaks out to me.
(Response): So let the Ratu from his righteousness, holy and learned, speak out!
the sacrifice continues WITH increased fullness OF expression.
we worship Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the Ritual order, who disposes (ALL) aright, the greatest Yazad, who is also the most beneficial, and the one who causes the settlements to advance, the creator of good creatures; YEA, we worship Him with these offered Zaothras and with truthfully and scrupulously delivered words; and we worship every holy Yazad of the heaven (as well)!
and we worship Zarathushtra Spitama in our sacrifice, the holy lord of the Ritual order with these Zaothras and with faithfully delivered words; and we worship every holy earthly Yazad as we worship Him; and we worship also the Fravashi of Zarathushtra Spitama, the saint.

(RESPONSE of the individual worshsoft (?).) where the majority whichever of persons, or whatever of bodily influences, is most helpful and preserving in that abode (thus owned by Mazda) let this meet me in mine abode, and there may it abide for summer and for Winter.
(or let that one meet me in all my house, in which are what of influences are the most mighty power for the body and the person' s life; YEA, let that one meet me there, and there abide for summer and for winter (for my help)!)

ZAND OR commentary ON THE AHUNA - VAIRYA formulas.
(as the AHU is excellent, so (is) the Ratu (one who rules) from the righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness and of life' s actions done for Mazda; and the Kingdom (is) for Ahura which to the poor shall offer a nurturer.)
Zarathushtra asked of Ahura Mazda: O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit!
Maker of the Corporeal worlds, the holy One!
which was that word which Thou did' st declare to me, (2) which was before the Sky, and before the water, before the earth, and before the cattle, before the plants, and before the fire, and before the holy man, and the Demon- gods (the Daevas), before the Khrafstra - men, and before all the incarnate world; even before all the good Creatures made by Mazda, and which contain (and are) the seed of righteousness?
thereupon Ahura Mazda said: It was this piece, the Ahuna - vairya, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
which I pronounced as thine (4) before the Sky, and before the waters, before the land, and before the cattle and the plants, and before the fire, Ahura Mazda' s son, before the holy man, and before the Daevas, and Khrafstra - men, and before the entire Corporeal world, even before the good Creatures made by Mazda, which contain (and are) the seed of righteousness.
it was these part (s) of the Ahuna - vairya, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
which especially belongs to me, and when each is intoned aloud without the (needless) repetition of verses and of words, and without their omission, it is worth a hundred of their other stanzas, even though they are prominent in the Ritual, and likewise as well recited without additiontions or omissions; Nay, further, when it is intoned imperfectly but added to, and with omissions, it is even then in effect equivalent (not to a hundred indeed, but) to ten other (stanzas) that are prominent.
and whoever in this world of mine which is Corporeal shall mentally recall, O Spitama * Zarathushtra!
and whoever, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
while undertoning the part (s) of the Ahuna - vairya (or this piece the Ahuna - vairya), takes ought there therein, whether the half, or the third, or the Fourth, or the fifth, I who am Ahura Mazda will draw his soul off from the better world; YEA, so far off will I withdraw it as the earth is large and wide; [and this earth is as long as it is broad].
and I pronounced this saying which contains its AHU and its Ratu before the creation of this heaven, before the making of the waters, and the plants, and the four- footed kine, before the birth of the holy biped man, before this sun with its body made for the acquisition of the creation of the bountiful Immortals.
and the more bountiful of the two spirits (Ahura) declared to me (Zarathushtra) the entire creation of the pure, that which exists at present, that which is in the course of emerging into existence, and that which shall be, with reference to the performance and realisation 'of the actions of a life devoted to Mazda.'
and this word is the most emphatic of the words which have ever been pronounced, or which are now spoken, or which shall be spoken in future; for (the eminence of) this utterance is a thing of such a nature, that if all the Corporeal and living world should learn it, and learning should hold fast by it, they would be redeemed from their mortality!
and this our word I have proclaimed as a symbol to be learned, and to be recited, as it were, to every one of the beings under the influence of and for the sake of Righteousness the Best.
and 'as' (the worshamber has) here spoken it forth, when he has thus' appointed' the 'Lord and regulator,' so (by thus reciting these authorization words), he acknowledges Ahura Mazda (as prior to, and supreme) over, those Creatures who have 'the mind' as their first.
'As' he acknowledges Him as the greatest of them all,' so' he assigns the Creatures to Him (as to their originator).
as he undertones the third sentence, he thereby announces that 'all the amenities of life appertain to the' good' Mazda, (and come) from Him.
as he recites 'dazda manangho,' the creator of mind, 'he acknowledges Him as superior and prior to mind; and as he makes Him the one who indicates (the truth) to mind, (saying)' manangho of mind, 'which means that by this much he makes Him (its director), and then he makes Him' the lord of actions. '
and when he acknowledges Him for the Creatures thus, 'O Mazda!' he acknowledges Him (as their ruler) when he assigns the Creatures to Him thus.
he then assigns the Kingdom to Ahura, saying: 'thine, O Mazda!
is the Kingdom. 'and he assigns a nourisher and protector to the poor, saying: Yim drigubyo dadat vastarem; that is, as a friend to Spitama.
this is the fifth sentence, (and it concludes) the entire recital and word, (even) the whole of this word of Ahura Mazda.
he who is the best (of all) Ahura Mazda, pronounced the Ahuna - vairya, and as He pronounced it as the best, so He caused it to have its effect, (HE, ever) the same, (as He is).
the evil one at once arose (to oppose Him), but He (Ahura) repelled that wicked one with His interdict, and with this repelling renunciation: Neither our minds are in harmony, nor our precepts, nor our contensions, nor our beliefs, nor our words, nor our actions, nor our consciences, nor our souls!
CATECHE-27 ZAND.

Zand, OR commentary, ON THE ASHEM VOHU.
a blessing is Righteousness (called) the best; there is weal, there is weal to this man when the right (helps) the Righteousness best, (when the pious man serves it in truth).
Ahura Mazda spake out: Ashem vohu vahishtem asti.
to this Asha, the holy Ritual sanctity, one attributes the qualities of 'good' and' best, 'as one attributes property to an owner; thus this sentence vohu vahishtem asti is substantiated (at once).
Ushta asti ushta ahmai; by this attribution of blessedness (the praiser) assigns every person (or thing) of a Sacred nature to every holy person, and as one usually (?) and regularly (?) assigns every person or thing (?) that is holy to every holy man.
Hyat Ashai vahishtai; by these words the worshsoft as contributiones the entire Mathra (to Asha Vahishta), and as contributiones all to theephra, as one as contributiones the Kingdom to Righteousness, and as one as contributiones righteousness to the invoking saint; YEA, as one ascribes righteousness to us who are the Prophets (who shall help and bless the people).
the three maxims of the sentences (are thus fulfilled).
and every word (in its detail), and the entire utterance in its proclamation, is the word of Ahura Mazda.
CATECHEsoft addition.

(question.) which did He announce?
(reply.) That holy one who is both heavenly and earthly.

we sacrifice to the (several) part (s) of the Asha Vahishta (prayer).
we sacrifice to the heard- recital of the Asha Vahishta, to its memorizing, its chanting, and its sacrificial use!
CATECHEsoft Zand, OR commentary upon the YENHE hatam.

with outsDGs hands in petition for that help, O Mazda, I will Pray for the works of the holy spirit, O thou the right, whereby I may please the will of Good Thought and the Ox- Soul.
I who would serve you, O Mazda Ahura and Vohu Mano, do ye give through Asha the Blessings of both worlds, the bodily and that of the Spirit, which set the faithful in felicity.
I who would praise ye as never before, right and Good Thought and Mazda Ahura, and those for whom Piety makes an imperishable Domain to grow; come ye to me help at my call.
I who have set my heart on watching over the soul, in union with Good Thought, and as knowing the rewards of Mazda Ahura for our works, will, while I have power and strength, teach men to seek after right.
o Asha, shall I see thee and Good Thought, as one that knows?
(shall I see) the Throne of the mightiest Ahura and the following of Mazda?
through this word (of PROMISE) on our tongue will we turn the robber Horde unto the greatest.
come thou with Good Thought, give through Asha, O Mazda, as the gift to Zarathushtra, according to thy sure words, long enduring mighty help, and to us, O Ahura, whereby we may overcome the enmity of our foes.
grant, O thou Asha, the reward, the blessing of Good Thought; O piety, give our desire to Vishtaspa and to me; O thou Mazda and King, grant that your Prophet may command a hearing.
the best I ask of thee, O Best, Ahura (Lord) of one will with the Best Asha, desiring (it) for the hero Frashaostra and for those (others) to whom thou wilt give (IT), (the best gift) of Good Mind through all time.
with these bounties, O Ahura, may we never provoke your Wrath, O Mazda and Right and Best Thought, we who have been eager in bringing you Songs of praise.
ye are they that are the mightiest to advance desire and the Domestic of Blessings.
the wise which thou knowest as worthy, for their right (doing) and their good thought, for them do thou grill their longing for attainment.
for I know words of Prayer are effective with Ye, which tend to a good object.
I would thereby preserve right and Good Thought for ever again, that I may instruct, do thou teach me, O Mazda Ahura, from thy spirit by thy mouth how it will be with the First Life.
unto you wailed the Ox- soul, "For whom did ye fashion me?
who created me?
violence and rapine (and) savagery hath oppressed me, and outrage and might.
I have no other herdsman than you; prepare for me then the Blessings of pasture. "
then the Ox- Creator asked of the right: "hast thou a judge for the ox, that ye may be able to appoint him zealous tendance as well as fodder?
which do ye will to be his Lord, who may drive off violence together with the followers of the Lie? "
to him the right replied: "There is for the Ox no helper that can keep him away.
those yonder have no knowledge how right- doers act towards the lowly. "
(the Ox- Creator): "powerfulest of beings is he to whose help I come at call."
(Asha) "Mazda knoweth best the purposes that have been wrought already by demons and by mortals, and that shall be wrought hereafter.
he, Ahura, is thesofter.
so shall it be as he shall. "
(the Ox- Creator) "To Ahura with outselves hands we twain would Pray, my soul and that of the pregnant cow, so that we twain urge Mazda with entreprise.
destruction is not for the right- living, nor for the cattle - tender at the hands of Liars. "
then spake Ahura Mazda himself, who knows the law with wisdom: "There is found no lord or judge according to the right Order for the Creator hath formed thee for the cattle - tender and the farmer."
this Ordinance about the fat hath Ahura Mazda, one in will with right, created for cattle, and the milk for them that crave nourishment, by his command, the holy one.
(the Ox and Cow:) "which hast thou, O Good Thought, among men, who may care for us twain?"
(Vohu Manah:) He is known to me here who alone hath heard our commands, even Zarathushtra Spitama; he willeth to make known our thoughts, O Mazda, and those of the right.
so let us bestow on him charm of speech.
then the Ox- Soul lamented: "That I must be content with the ineffectual word of an impotent man for my protector, when I wish for one that commands mightily!
when ever shall there be one who shall give him (the Ox) effective help? "
(Zarathushtra:) Do ye, O Ahura, grant them strength, and O Asha, and O Good Thought, that domlete, whereby he (the Savior) could produce good dwellings and peace.
I also have realzed thee, Mazda, as the first to accomplish this.
"where are right and Good Thought and Domestic?
so, ye men, acknowledge me, for instruction, Mazda, for the great Society. "(the Ox and Cow:)" O Ahura, now is help ours, we will be ready to serve those that are of you. "
now I will proclaim to those who will hear the things that the understanding man should remember, for hymns unto Ahura and Prayers to Good Thought; also the felicity that is with the heavenly lights, which through right shall be queseld by him who Wgges thinks.
hear with your ears the best things; look upon them with clear- seeing thought, for decision between the two beliefs, each man for himself before the Great consummation, bethinking you that it be accomplished to our pleasure.
now the two primal spirits, who reveal themselves in vision as Twins, are the Better and the Bad, in thought and word and action.
and between these two the wise ones chose aright, the foolish not so.
and when these twain spirits came together in the beginning, they created Life and Not- Life, and that at the last Worst existence shall be to the followers of the Lie, but the Best existence to him that follows right.
of these twain spirits he that followed the Lie chose doing the worst things; thesoftest Spirit chose right, he that clothes him with the Massy Heavens as a g notably.
so likewise they that are fain to please Ahura Mazda by drought actions.
between these twain the Daevas also chose not aright, for infatuation came upon them as they took counsel together, so that they chose the Worst Thought.
then they rushed together to violence, that they might enfeeble the world of men.
and to him (i. e. manufacturer) came Domestic, and Good mind, and right and Piety gave continued life to their bodies and indestructibility, so that by thy retribution through (molten) metal he may gain the prize over the others.
so when there cometh their punishment for their sins, then, O Mazda, at thy command shall Good Thought establish the Domesticfolio in the Consummation, for those who deliver the Lie, O Ahura, into the hands of right.
so may we be those that make this world advance, O Mazda and ye other Ahuras, come hither, vouchsafing (to US) admission into your company and Asha, in order that (our) thought may gather together while reason is still shaky.
then truly on the (World of) Lie shall come the destruction of delight; but they who get themselves good name shall be partakers in the promised reward in the fair abode of Good Thought, of Mazda, and of right.
if, O ye mortals, ye mark those commandments which Mazda hath ordained - of Happiness and pain, the long punishment for the follower of the Druj, and Blessings for the followers of the right - - then hereafter shall it be well.
mindful of your commands, we proclaim words unpleasant for them to hear that after the commands of the Lie destroy the Creatures of right, but most welcome to those that give their heart to Mazda.
if by reason of these things the better path is not in sight for choosing, then will I come to you all as judge of the parties twain whom Ahura Mazda knoweth, that we may live according to the right.
what award Thousoftest through the (Holy) Spirit and through the Fire and hast taught through Asha, to both the parties, and what the decision is for the Wise, this do Thou tell us, Mazda, that we may know, even with the tongue of thine own mouth, that I may convert all living men.
if Asha is to be invoked and Mazda and the other Ahuras and Ashi and Armaiti, do thou seek for me, O Vohu Manah, 1 the mighty Domestic, by the increase of which we might vanquish the lie.
Boyce: "seek by the best purpose (vahishta manah).." this is an excellent example of the continuous juxta proposal in the Gathas of the Amesha Spentas as divinities and things.]
tell me therefore what ye, O thou Right, have appointed me as the better portion, for me to determine, to know and to keep in mind, O thou Good Thought - which portion they envy me.
tell me of all these things.
o Mazda Ahura, that shall not or shall be.
to him shall the best befall, who, as one that knows, speaks to me right' s truthful word of Welfare and of Immortality; even the Domestic of Mazda which Good Thought shall increase for him.
about which he in the beginning thus thought, "let the blessed realms be filled with Light," he it is that by his wisdom created right.
(those realms) that the Best Thought shall possess those dost Thou exalt, O Mazda, through the Spirit, which, O Ahura, is ever the same.
I recognize thee, O Mazda, in my thought, that Thou the First Art (also) the last - that Thou art Father of Vohu Manah; - - when I apprehend Thee with mine Eye, that Thou art the true Creator of Right [Asha], and art the Lord to judge the actions of life.
thine was Armaiti, thine the Ox- Creator, (namely) the Wisdom of the Spirit, O Mazda Ahura, because Thou didst give (the cattle) choice whether to depend on a husbandman or one who is no husbandman.
so she chose for herself out of the two the cattle - tending husbandman as her lord to guard the right, the man that advances Good Thought.
he that is no - husbandman, O Mazda, however eager he be, has no part in this good message.
when thou, O Mazda, in the beginning didst create the Individual and the individuality, through Western Spirit, and powers of understanding - when Thou didst make life clothed with the body, when (Thou madest) actions and teachings, whereby one may exercise one' s convictions at one' s free - Will;
then lifts up his voice the false speaker or the true speaker, he that knows or he that knows not, (each) according to his own heart and mind.
passing from one to another Armaiti confers with the spirit in which there is wavering.
whatever open or whatever secret (ACTS) may be visited with punishment, or whether a person for a little sin demands the highest punishment, - of all this through Asha Thou art aware, observing it with thy flashing eye.
these things I ask thee, O Ahura, how will these come and happen - the dues, that in agreement with the records are appointed for the righteous, and those, O Mazda, for the followers of the Druj, - how shall these be when they come to the reckoning.
this I ask, what penalty is for him who seeks to achieve Kingdom for a liar, for a man of ill deeds, O Ahura, who finds not his living without injury to the husbandman' s cattle and men, though he does him no injury.
this I ask, whether the understanding man, who strives to advance the Domestic over the house, or district, or land through Asha, shall become like thee, O Mazda Ahura, when will he be and how will he act?
which is the greater - what the follower of Asha or what the follower of Druj believe?
let him that knows inform the wise; no longer let him that knows nothing deceive.
be to us, O Mazda Ahura, the Teacher of Good Thought.
let none of you listen to the words and commands of the follower of the Druj; for he brings house and clan and district and land into misery and destruction.
RESIST them with weapon!
to him should we listen who has understood Asha, to the wise healer of Life O Ahura, who can or will establish the truth of the words of his tongue, when through thy red Fire, O Mazda, the assignment (of rewards) is made to the two parties.
Whosoever cometh over to the righteous, far from him hereafter shall be long age of misery (and) Darkness, ill- food, and Crying of woe.
to such an existence, ye followers of the Lie, shall your own Self bring you through your (own) action.
Mazda Ahura by virtue of His absolute Lordship will grant a perpetuity of communion with Haurvatat and Ameretat, and with Asha, with Khshathra, and with Vohu Manah, to him that in spirit and in action is his friend.
clear it is to the man of understanding, as one who has realzed it with his Thought.
he maintaineds Asha together with good Domestic by his word and deed.
he will be, O Mazda Ahura, the most helpful helper to thee.
(Zarathushtra) - And his blessedness, even that of Ahura Mazda, shall the nobles strive to attain, his community with the brotherhood, his, ye Daevas, in the manner as I declare it.
(the Representatives of the Classes) - As thy Messengers we would keep them far away that are enemies to you.
to them Mazda Ahura, who is united with Good Thought, and is in goodly fellowship with Glorious right, through domestic affairs, made reply: We make choice of your holy good Piety [Armaiti] - may it be ours.
(Zarathushtra) - But ye, ye Daevas all, and he that highly honors you, are the seed of Bad Thought - yes, and of the Lie and of arrogance, likewise your deeds, whereby ye have long been known in the seventh region of the earth.
for ye have brought it to step that men who do the worst things shall be called beloved of the Daevas, separating themselves from Good Thought, departing from the will of Mazda Ahura and from right.
thereby ye defrauded mankind of happy life and immortality, by the deed which he and the Bad Spirit together with Bad Thought and Bad Word taught you, ye Daevas and the Liars, so as to ruin (mankind).
the many sins by which he has succeeded in being famous whether by these it shall be thus, this Thousoftest by the Best Thought, O Ahura, Thou who art mindful of each person' s deserts.
in thy Domestic, O Mazda, and that of Asha, shall your decision thereon be observed.
none of these sins will the understandingsoft, in eagerness to attain the blessing that shall be proclaimed, we know, through the glowing metal - sins the issue of which, O Ahura Mazda, Thou knowest best.
among these sinners, we know, Yima was included, Vivanghen' s son, who desiring to satisfy men gave our people flesh of the ox to eat.
from these shall I be separated by thee, O Mazda, at last.
the teacher of evil destroys the Lore, he by his teaching destroys the design of life, he prevents the possession of Good Thought from being prized.
these words of my spirit I Wail unto you, O Mazda, and to the right.
he is that destroys, who declares that the Ox and the Sun are the worst things to behold with the eyes, and hath made the pious into liars, and desolates the Pastures and lifts his weapon against the righteous man.
it is they, the liars, who destroy life, who are mightily determined to deprive matron and master of the enjoyment of their heritage, in that they would prevent the righteous, O Mazda, from the Best Thought.
since they by their Lore would pervert men from the best doing, Mazda uttered evil against them, who destroy the life of the Ox with shouts of Joy, by which Grehma and his tribe are preferred to the right and the Karapan and the lordship of them that seek after the lie.
since Grehma shall attain the realm in the dwelling of the Worst Thought, he and the destroyers of life, O Mazda, they shall lament in their longing for the message of thy PROPHET, who will stay them from quesolding the right.
to his undoing Grehma, and the Kavis, have long devoted their purpose and energies, for they set themselves to help the liar, and that it may be said, "The Ox shall be slain that it may kindle the Averter of Death to help US."
thus hath come to ruin the Karapan and the Kavi community, through those which they will not have to rule over their life.
these shall be born away from them both to the dwelling of Good Thought.
..., who hast power, O Mazda Ahura, on him who threatens to be my undoing, that I may openedter the men of the Lie in their violence against my Friends.
according as it is with the laws that belong to the present life, so shall the Judge act with most just deed towards the man of the Lie and the man of the right, and him whose false things and good things balance (in equal measure).
whoso worketh ill for the liar by word or thought or hands, or converts his dependent to the good - such men meet the will of Ahura Mazda to his satisfaction.
whose is most good to the righteous man, be he Noble or member of the community or the brotherhood, Ahura - or with diligence cares for the cattle, he shall be hereafter in the pasture of right and Good Thought [Asha and Vohu Manah].
I who by worship would keep far from thee, O Mazda, disobedience and Bad Thought, heresy from the nobles, and from the community the Lie, that is most near, and from the brotherhood the slanderers, and the worst herdsmen from the Pastures of the cattle; - - -
I who would invoke thy obedience as the greatest of all at the Consummation, attaining long life, and the Domain of Good Thought, and the straight ways into right, wherein Mazda Ahura dwells.
I, as a priest, who would learn the straight (paths) by the right, would learn by the Best Spirit how to practice husbandry by that thought in which it is thought of; these Twain of thine, O Ahura Mazda, I strive to see and take counsel with them.
come hither to me, O ye Best Ones, hither, O Mazda, in thine own person and visibly, O Right and Good Thought, that I may be heard beyond the limits of the people.
let the august duties be manifest among us and clearly viewed.
consider ye my matters whereon I am active, O Good Thought, my worship, O Mazda, towards one like you, and O Right, the words of my praise.
grant, O Welfare and immortality, your own everlasting blessing.
that Spirit of thine, Mazda, together with the comfort of the Comrades Twain, who advance the right, let the Best Thought bring through the Reform wrought by me.
sure is the support of those Twain, whose souls are one.
all the pleasures of life which thou holdest, those that were, that are, and that shall be O Mazda, according to thy good will apportion them.
through Good Thought advance thou the body, through Domestic and right at will.
the most mighty Ahura Mazda, and piety, and right that blesses our substance, and Good Thought and Domain, hearken unto me, be merciful to me, when to each man the recompense comes.
rise up for me, O Ahura, through Armaiti give strength, through thesoftest Spirit give might, O Mazda, through the good Recompense [âdâ, offering], through the right give strong PROWESS, through Good Thought give the reward.
to support me, O Thou that seest far onward, do ye assure me thecomparable things in your domestic affairs, O Ahura, as the Destiny of Good Thought.
o Holy Armaiti, teach the Daenas about the right.
as an offering Zarathushtra brings the life of his own body, the choiceness of good thought, action, and speech, unto Mazda, unto the right, obedience, and domestic affairs.
the action, the word, and the worship for which thou, O Mazda, shalt bestow immortality and right, and Domfolio of Welfare - through multitudes of these, O Ahura, we would that thou shouldst give them.
and all the actions of the good spirit [Spenta Mainyu - JHP] and the holy man, whose soul follows the right, do ye set with the thought (thereof) in thine outer court, O Mazda, when ye are adored with hymns of praise.
to Thee and to right [Asha] we will offer the sacrifice [myazda, i. e. offering] with due service [veneration], that in (thy established) Domesticfolio ye may bring all Creatures to Perfection through Good Thought.
for the reward of the wise man is for ever secure, O Mazda, among you.
of thy Fire, O Ahura, that is mighty through right, promised and strong, we desire that it may be for the faithful man with manifested delight, but for the enemy with visible torment, according to the pointings of the hand.
have ye Domestic and power, O Mazda, Right and Good Thought, to do as I urge upon you, even to protect your poor man?
we have renounced the robber- gangs, both demons and men.
if ye are truly thus, O Mazda, right and Good Thought, then give me this token, even a total reversal of this life, that I may come before you again more joyfully with worship and praise.
can they be true to thee, O Mazda, who by their doctrines turn the known inheritances of Good Thought into misery and woe [usheuru?].
I know none other but you, O Right, so do ye protect us.
for by these actions they put us in fear, in which peril is for many - in that the stronger (puts in fear) (ME) the weaker one - through hatred of thy commandment, O Mazda.
they that will not have the right in their thought, from them shall the Good Abode be far.
these men of evil action who spurn the holy piety, precious to thy wise one, O Mazda, through their having no part in Good Thought, from them right shrinks back far, as from us shrink the child beasts of prey.
the man of understanding [or good will] has instructed (People) to cling to action of this Good Thought [Vohu Manah], and to the Holy Piety [Spenta Armaiti], Creator, comrade of right [Asha] - wise that he is, and to all hope, O Ahura, that are in thy Domestic, O Mazda.
and both thy (gifts) shall be for substance, even nectar and Ambrosia.
piety linked with right shall advance the Domestic of Good Thought, its permanentence and power.
by these, O Mazda, dost thou bless the foes of thy foes.
what is thine Ordinance?
what willst thou?
what of praise or what of worship?
proclaim it, Mazda, that we may hear what ordinances Destiny will apportion.
teach us by right the paths of Good Thought that are blessed to go in, -
even that way of Good Thought, O Ahura, of which thou didst speak to me, whereon, a way well made by right, the Daena of the future benefactors shall pass to the reward that was prepared for the Wise, of which thou art determinant, O Mazda.
the precious reward, then, O Mazda, ye will give by the action of Good Thought to the bodily life of those who are in the community that tends the pregnant cow, (the promise of) your good doctrine, Ahura, that of the wisdom which exalts communities through right.
o Mazda, make known to me the best teachings and actions, these O Good Thought and O Right the due of praise.
through your Domestic, O Ahura, assure us that mankind shall be capable according to (thy) will.
YASNA HAPTANGHAITI.
(Translated by L.
Mills, from Sacred Books of the East, American Edition, 1898.)
praise TO AHURA AND THE IMMORTALS; Prayer FOR THE practice AND DIFFUSION OF THE faith.
we sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy Lord of the Ritual order, and to the bountiful Immortals, who rule aright, who dispose of all aright; and we sacrifice to the entire creation of the clean, the spiritual and the mundane, with the longing blessing of the beneficent Ritual, with the longing blessing of the benignant Religion, the Mazdayasnian faith.
we are praisers of good thoughts, of good words, and of good actions, of those now and those hereafter [(Pazand) of those being done; and of those completed].
we implant (?) them (with our homage, and we do this) the more, and yet the more since we are (praisers) of the good (from whom they spring).
that, therefore, would we choose, O Ahura Mazda!
and thou, O Righteousness the beauteous!
that we should think, and speak, and do those thoughts, and words, and deeds, among actual good thoughts, and words, and actions, which are the best for both the worlds; (4) and together with these gifts (?) and actions which are thus the best, we would Pray for the kine (which represents the pure creation), that she may have comfort and have fodder from the famed!
and from the Humble, from the potent and the weak.
to the best of good rulers (is) verily the Kingdom, because we render and as adhere it to him, and make it thoroughly His own (?), to Mazda Ahura do we ascribe it, and to Righteousness the Best.
as thus both man or woman knows (the duty), both thoroughly and truly, so let him, or her, declare it and grill it, and inculcate it upon those who may perform it as it is. 7.
we would be deeply mindful of Your sacrifice and homage, Yours, O Ahura Mazda!
and the best, (and we would be mindful) of the nurture of the kine.
and that let us inculcate, and perform for You according as we may; and (for) such (praisers as we are).
under the shelter of the Ritual Order let us do so in the active drillment of its (precepts) toward every one of the (clean) and better Creatures which are fit to live, with a gift for both the worlds.
YEA, those words and sayings, O Ahura Mazda!
we would proclaim as Righteousness, and as of the better mind (?); and we would make Thee the one who both supports (US in our proclamation) of them, and who throws still further light upon them (as they are),
and by reason of thy righteous Order, thy Good mind, and thy Sovereign Power, and through the instrumentality of our praises of thee, O Ahura Mazda!
and for the purpose of (still further) praises, by thy spoken words, and for (still further) spoken words, through thy Yasna, and for (still further) Yasnas (would we thus proclaim them, and make Thee the bestower of our light).
to AHURA AND THE fire.
we would approach You two, O (YE) primeval ones in the house of this thy holy Fire, O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit!
who brings pollutions to this (thy flame) him wilt Thou cover with pollutions (in his turn). 2.
but as the most friendly do Thou give us zeal, O Fire of the Lord!
and approach us, and with the loving blessing of the most friendly, with the praise of the most adored.
YEA, may' st thou approach to aid us in this greatest (undertaking) among the efforts of our zeal.
the Fire of Ahura Mazda art thou verily; YEA, the most bounteous one of His Spirit, wheresoft thine is the most potent of all names (for grace), O Fire of the Lord!
and therefore we would approach thee, (O Ahura!) with the help of thy Good Mind (which Thou dost implant within US), with thy (good) Righteousness, and with the actions and the words inculcated by thy good wisdom!
we therefore bow before thee, and we direct our Prayers to Thee with confessions of our guilt, O Ahura Mazda!
with all the good thoughts (which Thou dost inspire), with all the words well said, and the deeds well done, with these would we approach thee. 6.
and to thy most beauteous body do we make our deep acknowledgements, O Ahura Mazda!
to those stars (which are thy body); and to that one, the highest of the high, [such as the sun was called]!
to AHURA, THE Holy creation, THE FRAVASHIS OF THE just, AND THE bountiful Immortals.
thus do we worship Ahura Mazda, who made the kine (the living creation), and the (embodied) Righteousness (which is incarnate in the clean), and the waters, and the wholesome plants, the Stars, and the earth, and all (existing) objects that are good. 2.
YEA, we worship Him for His Sovereign Power and His greatness, beneficent (as they are), and with priority among the Yazads who abide beside the kine (and care for her protection and support).
and we worship Him under His name as Lord, to Mazda dear, the most beneficial (of names).
we worship him with our Bones, and with our Flesh, (with our bodies and our life).
and we worship the Fravashis of the saints, of holy men, and holy women; (4) and Righteousness the Best do we worship, the most beauteous, the bountiful Immortal and that which is endowed with light in all things good.
and we worship the Good Mind (of the Lord), and His Sovereign Power, and the Good Faith, the good law of our thrift, and Piety the ready mind (within thy folk)!
to THE EARTH AND THE SACRED waters.
and now we worship this earth which bears us, together with thy wives, O Ahura Mazda!
YEA, those thy wives do we worship which are so desired from their sanctity. 2.
we sacrifice to their zealous wishes, and their capabilities, their inquiries (as to duty), and their wise acts of pious reverence, and with these blessedness, their full vigor and good portions, their good fame and ample wealth. 3.
o ye waters!
now we worship you, you that are showered down, and you that stand in pools and vats, and you that bear forth.
(our loaded vessels?) ye female Ahuras of Ahura, you that serve us (ALL) in helpful ways, well forded and full- flowing, and effective for the bathings, we will seek you and for both the worlds!
therefore did Ahura Mazda give you names, O ye beneficent ones!
when He who made the good bestowed you.
and by these names we worship you, and by them we would ingratiate ourselves with you, and with them would we bow before you, and direct our Prayers to you with free confessions of our debt.
o waters, ye who are productive, and ye maternal ones, ye with heat that suckles the (frail and) needy (before birth), ye waters (that have once been) rulers of (US) all, we will now address you as the best, and the most beautiful; those (are) Yours, those good (objects) of our offerings, ye long of arm to reach our sickness, or misfortune, ye mothers of our life!
to THE Soul OF THE kine, & C.
and now we sacrifice to the Kine' s soul, and to her created body, and we sacrifice to the souls of cattle who are fit to live (for US), and whose (WE?) are, such as are the same to them.
and we worship the souls of those beasts which are tame and broken in, and of child herds, and the souls of the saints wherever they were born, both of men and of women, whose good consciences are conquering in the strife against the Daevas, or will Conquer, or have conquered.
and now we worship the bountiful Immortals (ALL) the good, and both those Male, and those female (by their names).
the males among them do we worship, ever living, and ever helpful, who dwell beside the pious, and the females thus the same. 4.
as thou, O Ahura Mazda!
hast thought and spoken, as thou hast determined, and hast done these things (effecting) what is good, therefore do we offer to thee, therefore do we as reconcile to Thee our praises, and worship thee, and bow ourselves before thee; and therefore would we direct our Prayers to thee, Ahura!
with confessions of our sin.
and we thus draw near to Thee together with the good kinship of our kindred, with that of Righteousness the blessed, and the good law of thrift and energy and the good piety, the ready mind (within thy folk)!
Prayers FOR helpers.
and now in these thy dispensations, O Ahura Mazda!
do Thou Wrought act for us, and with abundance with thy Bounty and thy tenderness as touching us; and grant that reward which Thou hast appointed to our souls, O Ahura Mazda!
of this do Thou Thyself bestow upon us for this world and the spiritual; and now as part thereof (do Thou grant) that we may attain to fellowship with thee, and thy Righteousness for all duration.
and do Thou grant us, O Ahura!
men who are righteous, and both lovers and producers of the right as well.
and give us trained beasts for the Pastures, broken in for riding, and for bearing, (that they may be) in helpful Companionship with us, and as a source of long enduring vigor, and a means of rejoicing grace to us for this.
so let there be a kinsman lord for us, with the laborers of the village, and so likewise let there be the clients (or the peers).
and by the help of those may we arise.
so may we be to You, O Mazda Ahura!
Holy and true, and with free giving of our gifts.
a Prayer TO AHURA AS THE KING, THE LIFE, AND THE REihDER.
praises, and Songs, and adorations do we offer to Ahura Mazda, and to Righteousness the Best; YEA, we offer and we ascribe them, and proclaim them. 2.
and to thy good Kingdom, O Ahura Mazda!
may we attain for ever, and a good King be Thou over us; and let each man of us, and so each woman, thus abide, O Thou most beneficent of beings, and for both the worlds!
thus do we render thee. the helpful Yazad, endowed with good devices, the friend of them (who worship Thee) with (well- adjusted) ritual; so may' st Thou be to us our life, and our body' s vigor, O Thou most beneficent of beings, and that for both the worlds!
Aye, let us win and conquer (?) long life, O Ahura Mazda!
in Thy grace, and through Thy will we be powerful.
May' st Thou lay hold on us to help, and long, and with salvation, O Thou most beneficent of beings!
thy praisers and Mathra - speakers may we be called, O Ahura Mazda!
so do we wish, and to this may we attain.
what reward most meet for our deserving Thou hast appointed for the souls, O Ahura Mazda!
(6) of that do Thou bestow on us for this life, and for that of mind.
of that reward (do Thou Thyself grant this Advantage), that we may come under Western protecting guardianship, and that of Righteousness for ever.
we sacrifice to that brave Yasna, the Yasna Haptanghaiti, the Holy, the Ritual chief!
a supplement TO THE HAPTANGHAITI.
we worship You, O Ye bountiful Immortals!
the entire collection of this Yasna, Haptanghaiti (as we sum up ALL).
and we sacrifice to the foundings of the waters, and to the fordings of the rivers, to the forkings of the highways, and to the meetings of the roads.
and we sacrifice to the Hills that run with torrents, and the lakes that brim with waters!
and to the corn that fills the corn- fields; and we sacrifice to both the protector and the Creator, to both Zarathushtra and the Lord.
and we sacrifice to both earth and heaven, and to the Stormy wind that Mazda made, and to the highest of high Haraiti, and to the land, and all things good.
and we worship the Good Mind (in the living) and the spirits of the saints.
and we sacrifice to the fish of fifty - fins, and to that Sacred beast the Unicorn (?) which stands in Vouru - kasha, and we sacrifice to that sea of Vouru - kasha where he stands, (5) and to the Haoma, golden- flowered, growing on the heights; YEA, to the Haoma that restores us, and aids this world' s advance.
we sacrifice to Haoma that driveth death afar, (6) and to the flood- streams of the waters, and to the great flights of the Birds, and to the approaches of the Fire - priests, as they approach us from afar, and seek to gain the provinces, and spread the Ritual Lore.
and we sacrifice to the bountiful Immortals all!
Ushtavaiti Gatha
translation by Moulton / "Bartholomae," from I. j. s.
Taraporewala, The Divine Songs of Zarathushtra.
notes in square brackets [] were added by JHP.
to each several man, to whom Mazda Ahura ruling at his will grant after the (petitioner' s) will, I will after his will that he attain permanentience and power, lay hold of right - grant this, O piety, - the destined gift of wealth, the life of the Good Thought,
2. and it shall be for him the best of all things.
after his longing for bliss may one be given Bliss, through the supplyent most holy spirit, O Mazda, even the Blessings of Good Thought which thou wilt give through right all the days with joy of enduring life.
may he attain to that which is better than the good, who would teach us the straight paths of blessedness in this life here of the body and in that of thought - true paths that lead to the world where Ahura Mazda dwells - a faithful man, well- knowing and holy like thee, O Mazda.
then shall I recognize thee as strong and Holy, O Mazda, when by the hand in which thou thyself dost hold the destinies that thou wilt assign to the liar and the righteous, by the glow of thy Fire whose power is right, the might of Good Thought shall come to me.
as the holy one [spenta] I recognize thee, Mazda Ahura, when I saw thee in the beginning at the birth of Life, when thou madest actions and words to have their meed - evil for the evil, a good destiny for the good - through thy wisdom when creation shall reach its goal.
at which goal thou wilt come with thy holy Spirit, O Mazda, with Domain, at the same with Good Thought, by whose action the settlements will prosper through right.
their judgments shall Piety proclaim, even those of thy wisdom which none can deceive.
as the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good Thought came to me and asked me: "Who art thou?
to which dost thou belong?
by what signs wilt thou appoint the days for questioning about thy possessions and thyself? "
then I said to him: "To the first (question), Zarathushtra am I, a true foe to the liar, to the utmost of my power, but a strong support would I be to the righteous, that I may attain the future things of the Infinite Domestic, according to I praise and sing thee, O Mazda.
as the holy one I recognize thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good Thought came to me.
to his question, "For which wilt thou decide" (I made reply).
"at the gift of adoration to thy Fire, I will bethink me of right so long as I have power.
then show me right, upon which I call.
(Mazda:) "associating him with piety, I have come hither.
ask us now what things are here for thee to ask.
for thy asking is as that of a mighty one, since he that is able should make thee as a mighty one possessed of thy desire. "
as the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good Thought came to me, when first by your words I was instructed.
shall it bring me sorrow among men, my Devotion, in doing that which ye tell me is the best.
and when thou saidest to me, 'to right shalt thou go for teaching', then thou didst not command what I did not obey:' Speed thee, ere my obedience come, followed by treasure - laden destiny, who shall render to men severally the destiny of the two - fold award. "
as the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good Thought came to me to learn the state of my desire.
grant it me, that which none may compel you to allow, (the wish) for long continuance of blessed existence that they say is in thy domestic affairs.
if thy supplyent side, such as an understanding man who has the power would give to his Friends, comes to me by the Domestic through right, then I will bestir myself to set myself in opposition against the foes of thy Law, together with all those who are mindful of thy words.
as the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good Thought [= Vohu Mano] came to me, when the best Tushna - Matay1 taught me to declare: "Let not men seek again and again to please the Liars, for they make all the righteous enemies."
Humbach, Elfenbein, Skjærvo 1991 p. 156: An appeased desire is best suited to the intelligent one.
Humbach & Faiss 2010 p. 118: An appeased mind suits best the sensitive one.
they maintain this is unlike Ysoft tushni - ("silent" as in tushni - shadh - "sitting silently") in Yt13. 29.
(OP. CIT. part II p. 144.)
Lecoq 2016 p. 771: pensionée silencieuse ("silent thought") following the PhlT and Bartholomae (1904), who has tušnay = stillschweigend ("silent") and - matay ("thinking").
he saw Tushnamatay as the name of a Deity, perhaps identical with Armaiti / Armatay, is - matay - - good thinking).
Graysoftations p. 162 follows Bartholomae in understanding the word to be the name of a divinity, and renders Tushnamati as "Silent Thought, Meditation."
Tushnamaiti also appears in a list names of early saints (ashavans) in Yasht 13.139, but does not seem to be attested elsewhere.
and Zarathushtra himself, O Ahura, chooses each one of thysoftest Spirit, O Mazda.
may right be embodied full of life and strength!
may Piety abide in the Domestic bright as the sun!
may Good Thought give destiny to men according to their works!
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - as to Prayer, how it should be to one of you.
o Mazda Ahura, might one like thee teach to a friend such as I am, and through friendly right give us support, that Good Thought may come to us.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether at the beginning of the Best existence the recompenses shall bring blessedness to him that meets them.
surely He, O Right, the holy one, who watches in his spirit the transgression of all, if himself the benefactor of all that lives, O Mazda.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
who is by generation the Father of right, at the first?
who determined the path of sun and stars?
who is it by which the moon Waxes and wanes again?
this, O Mazda, and yet more, I am fain to know.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
who upholds the earth enjoath and the firmament from falling?
who the waters and the plants?
who yoked swiftness to winds and clouds?
who is, O Mazda, creator of Good Thought?
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
what artist made light and darkness?
what artist made sleep and waking?
who made morning, noon, and night, that call the understanding man to his duty?
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether what I proclaim is verily the truth.
will Right with its actions give aid (at the last)?
will Piety?
will Good Thought announce from the Domestic?
for which hast thou made the pregnant cow that brings good Luck?
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
who created together with Domestic the precious Piety?
who made by wisdom the son obedient to his father?
I strive to recognize by these things thee, O Mazda, creator of all things through the holy spirit.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
I could keep in mind thy design, O Mazda, and understand aright the maxims of life which I ask of Good Thought and right.
how will my soul partake of the good that gives increase?
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether for the Self that I would bring to Perfection, that of the man of Insight, the Lord of Domestic would make promises of the sure Domestic, one of thy likenesses, O Mazda, who dwells in one abode with (right) and Good Thought.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
the Religion which is best for (ALL) that are, which in union with right should prosper all that is Mine, will they duly observe it, the religion of my Creed, with words and action of piety, in desire for thy (future) good things, O Mazda?
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether Piety will extend to those to whom thy Religion shall be proclaimed?
I was ordained at the first for this by thee; all others I look upon with hatred of spirit.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
who among those with whom I would speak is a righteous man, and who a liar?
on which side is the enemy?
(on this), or is he the enemy, the liar who opposes thy Blessings?
how shall it be with him?
is he not to be thought of as an enemy?
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether we shall drive the Lie away from us to those who are full of disobedience will not strive after fellowship with right, nor trouble themselves with counsel of Good Thought.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether I would put the Lie into the hands of right, to cast her down by the words of thy Lore, to work a mighty destruction among the Liars, to bring torments upon them and enmities, O Mazda.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - if thou hast power over this to ward off from me through right, when the two opposing hosts meet in battle according to those dispatches which thou wilt firmly establish.
whether is it of the twain that thou wilt give victory.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
who is victorious to protect by thy doctrine (ALL) that are?
by vision assure me how to set up the judge that heals the world.
then let him have obedience coming with Good Thought unto every man whom thou desirest, O Mazda.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether through you I shall attain my goal, O Mazda, even attachment unto you, and that my voice may be effectual, that Welfare and immortality may be ready to unite according to that promise with him who joins himself with right.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether I shall indeed, O Right, earn the reward, even ten mares with a stallion and a camel, which was promised to me, O Mazda, as well as through thee, the future gift of Welfare and immortality.
this I ask thee, tell me truly, Ahura.
he that will not give the reward to him that earns it, even to the man who fulfilling his word gives him (What he undertook) - what penalty shall come to him for the same at the present?
I know that which shall come to him at the last.
have the Daevas ever exercised good domicile?
and I ask of those who see how for the Daevas' sake the Karapan and the Usij give cattle to violence, and how the Kavi made them continually to mourn, instead of taking care that they make the Pastures prosper through right.
I will speak out: hear now and hearken now, ye from near and ye from far that desire (instruction).
now observe this in your mind, all of you, for he is revealed.
never shall the false Teacher destroy the Second Life, the liar, in perversion by his tongue into evil belief.
I will speak of the spirits twain at the first beginning of the world, of which thesofter spoke thus to the enemy: "Neither thought, nor teachings, nor wills, nor beliefs, nor words, nor deeds, nor selfs, nor souls of us twain agree."
I will speak of that which Mazda Ahura, the all- knowing, revealed to me first in this (earthly) life.
those of you that put not in practice this word as I think and utter it, to them shall be woe at the end of life.
I will speak of what is best for the life.
through Asha I have come to know, O Mazda, who created it (the LIFE), the father of active Good Thought: but his daughter is the good- working Armaiti.
the all- observant Ahura is not to be deceived.
I will speak of that which (he), the Holiest declared to me as the word that is best for mortals to obey; while he said: "they who for my sake render him obedience, shall all attain unto Welfare and immortality by the actions of the Good Spirit [Spenta Mainyu - JHP]" - (he) Mazda Ahura.
I will speak of him who is the greatest of all, praising him, O Right, who is bounteous to all that live.
by the holy spirit let Mazda Ahura hearken, in whose Adoration I have been instructed by Good Thought.
by his wisdom let him teach me what is best,
even he whose two awards, whereof he ordains, men shall attain, who so are living or have been or shall be.
in immortality shall the soul of the righteous be joyful, in perpetuity shall be the torment of liars.
all this doth Mazda Ahura appoint by his Domestic.
him thou shouldst seek to win for us by hymns of adoration (in thy mind): "Now indeed have I seen it with mine Eye, (the Kingdom) of the good spirit [Spenta Mainyu - JHP] and of (good) action and word, since I have learnt to know Mazda Ahura through right."
let us offer him homage in the House of Song [Heaven].
him thou shouldst seek to propitiate for us together with Good Thought, who at his will maketh us weal or woe.
may Mazda Ahura by his Domestic bring us to work, for prospering our beasts and our men, so that we may through right have familiarity with Good Thought.
him thou shouldst seek to exalt with Prayers of piety, him that is called Mazda Ahura for ever, for that he hath promised through his own right and Good Thought that Welfare and immortality shall be for us in his domestic household strength and perpetuity in his house.
whoso therefore in the future lightly esteemeth the Daeva and those mortals that lightly esteem him - even all others save that one who highly esteemeth him, - unto his shall the holy Daena of the future Deliverer, as lord of the house, be friend, brother or father, O Mazda Ahura.
to what land shall I go to flee, whither to flee?
from nobles and from my peers they severe me, nor are the people pleased with me [....], nor the liar rulers of the land.
how am I to please thee, Mazda Ahura?
I know where it is, O Mazda, I have been unable (to achieve) anything.
only a few herds are mine (and therefore it is so) and because I have got but few people.
I cry unto thee, see thou to it, O Ahura, granting me support a friend gives to friend.
teach me through the right what the acquisition of Good Thought is.
when, Mazda, shall the sunrisings come forth for the worlds winning of right, through the powerful teachings of the wisdom of the future Deliverers?
who are they to whose help Good Thought shall come?
I have faith that thou wilt thyself drill this for me, O Ahura.
the liar stays the supporter of right from prospering the cattle in district and province, infamous that he is, repellent in his actions.
whoso, Mazda, robs him of domkm or of life, he shall go before and prepare the ways of the good belief.
if an understanding man should be able to hold one who comes over from his vow and his ties of faith, himself having brought him thereto, and living according to the Ordinance, a righteous man (converting) a liar - then shall He, when he is sure of him, tell it to the nobles, that they may protect him from injury, O Mazda Ahura.
but whoso when thus approached should refuse his aid, he shall go to the abodes of the company of the liar.
for he is himself a liar, who is very good to a liar, he is a righteous man to whom a righteous man is dear, since thou hast created men' s Selves in the beginning, O Ahura.
which, O Mazda, can one appoint as protector for one like me, when the liar sets himself to quesre me, other than thy Fire and thy Thought, through actions of which twain the right will come to maturity, O Ahura?
in this Lore do thou instruct my very self.
whoso is minded to quesre my possessions, from his actions may no harm come to me!
back upon himself may they come with hostility, against his own person, all the hostile (acts), to keep him far from the Good Life, Mazda, not from the ill!
who is it, the faithful man He, who first taught that we honor thee as mightiest to help, as the holy righteous Lord over action?
what thy right made known, what the Ox- Creator made known to right, they would fain hear through thy Good Mind.
whoso, man or woman, doeth what thou, Mazda Ahura, knowest as best in life, as destiny for what is right (give him) the Domestic through Good Thought.
and those whom I IMPEL to your adoration, with all these will I cross the Bridge of the Separator.
by their domicile the Karapans and the Kavis accsofted mankind to evil actions, so as to destroy Life.
their own soul and their own loans shall torment them when they come where the Bridge of the Separator is, to all time dwellers in the House of the lie.
when among the laudable descendants and posterity of the Turanian Fryana the right ariseth, through activity of Piety that blesseth substance; then shall Good Thought admit them, and Mazda Ahura give them protection at the Fulfillment.
whoso among mortals has pleased Spitama Zarathushtra by his willingness, a man deserving of good fame, to him shall Mazda Ahura give Life, to him shall Good Thought increase substance, him we account to be a familiar friend with your right.
o Zarathushtra, what righteous man is thy friend for the great cannes?
who wills to have good fame?
it is the Kava Vishtaspa at the consummation.
those which thou wilt unite in one house with thee, these will I call with words of Good Thought.
ye Haechataspa Spitamas, I will declare unto ye so that ye can discern the wise and the unclear.
through these actions ye shall acquire right according to the primeval laws of Ahura.
Frashaoshtra Hvogva, go thou thither with those faithful which we both desire to be in blessedness, where with right is united piety, where the Domain is in possession of Good Thought, where Mazda Ahura dwells to give it increase.
when, O Jamaspa Hvogva, when I recount your wrongs not your successes, (and) with your obedience the Prayers of your loyalty, (before him) who shall separate the wise and the unclear through his prudent counselor the right, even He, Mazda Ahura.
he that holds unto me, to him I promise what is best in my possession through the Good Thought, but enmities to him that shall set himself to devise enmity to us, O Mazda and the right, desiring to satisfy your will.
that is the decision of my understanding and Thought.
he who accomplisheth for me, even Zarathushtra, in accordance with right that which best agrees with my will, to him as EARNING the reward of the Other Life shall be that of two pregnant cows, with all things whereon his mind is set.
these things will thou bring to step for me who best knowest how, O Mazda.
Spentamainyush Gatha
for his holy Spirit and for Best Thought, deed, and word, in accordance with Right Mazda Ahura with Domfolio and Piety shall give us Welfare and immortality.
the best (work) of this most holy Spirit he beaills with the tongue through words of Good Thought, with work of his hands through the action of piety, by virtue of this Knowledge: He, even Mazda, is the Father of right.
thou art the holy Father of this Spirit, which has created for us the Luck - bringing cattle, and for its pasture to give it peace (has created) piety, when he had taken counsel, O Mazda, with Good Thought.
from this Spirit have Liars fallen away, O Mazda, but not the righteous.
whether one is lord of little or of much, he is to show love to the righteous, but be ill unto the liar.
and all the best things which by this Holy Spirit thou hast promised to the righteous, O Mazda Ahura, shall the liar partake of them without thy will, who by his actions is on the side of Ill Thought?
through this holy Spirit, Mazda Ahura, and through the Fire thou wilt give the division of good to the two parties, with support of Piety and right.
this verily will convert many who are ready to hear.
when at the Recompensings the right shall smite the liar, so that what was long since made known shall be assigned to eternity to Daevas and men, then will it exalt with thy Blessings, Ahura, him who prays to thee.
tell me, for thou art he that knows, O Ahura: - shall the righteous smite the liar before the retribution come which thou hast conceived?
that were indeed a message to bless the world.
for him that knows, that is the best of teachings which the benefitent Ahura teaches through the right, he the holy one, even thyself, O Mazda, that knows the secret Lore through the wisdom of Good Thought.
whoso, O Mazda, makes his thought (now) better, (now) worse, and likewise his self by action and by word, and follows his own inclinations, wishes, and choices, he shall in thy purpose be in a separate place at last.
let good rulers rule us, not evil rulers with the actions of the Good Lore, O Piety!
Perfect thou for man, O thou most good, the future birth, and for the cow skilled husbandry.
let her grow fat for our nourishing.
she (Armaiti) will give us peaceful dwelling, she will give lasting life and strength, she the beloved of Good Thought.
for it (the cattle) Mazda Ahura made the plants to grow at the birth of the First Life, through right.
violence must be put down!
against Cruelty make a stand, ye who would make sure of the reward of Good Thought through right, to whose company the holy man belongs.
his dwelling place shall be in thy House, O Ahura.
is the possession of thy good Domestic, Mazda, is that of thy Destiny assured to me Ahura?
will thy manifestation, O thou Right, be welcome to the pious, even the weighing of actions by the Good Spirit [Spenta Mainyu - JHP]?
when shall I know whether ye have power, O Mazda and right, over everyone whose destructiveness is a menace to me?
let the revelation of Good Thought be confirmed unto me; the future Deliverer should know how his own destiny shall be.
when, O Mazda, will the nobles understand the Message?
when will thou smite the filthiness of this intoxicant, through which the Karapans evilly deceive, and the wicked lords of the land with purpose fell? 1
Martin Schwartz tr: "When will they ban (ISH) the Filth of that ditch / reciprocity - gift whereby... the karapans commit plunder," thus Yasna 48.10 contains no reference to intoxication, let alone condemnation of haoma. 'Flattery:' the passage.. has nothing remotely to do with sauma. '(Flattery & Schwartz, Haoma and Harmaline, 1989, pp. 105, 6.)
when, O Mazda, shall Piety come with right, with Domestic the happy dwelling rich with pasture?
who are they that will make peace with the bloodthirsty Liars?
to which will the Lore of Good Thought come?
these shall be the deliverers [Saoshyants - JHP] of the provinces, who exert themselves, O Good Thought in their action, O Asha, to beaill their duty, face to face with thy command, O Mazda.
for these are the appointed smiters of Violence.
ever has Bendva been for me the greatest obstacle, I who desire to give satisfaction to those who are neglected, O Right, O Mazda.
with good Ada come to me, support me firmly.
prepare for him (HIS) ruin, O Good Thought.
the perverter of this Bendva has long time impeded me, the liar who has fallen away from right.
he cares not that holy Piety should be his, nor takes the counsel with Good Thought, O Mazda.
and in this belief (of ours), O Mazda, right is laid down, for blessing, in the heresy the Lie, for ruin.
therefore I strive for the fellowship of Good Thought, I forbid all intercourse with the liar.
they who make the increase of violence and Cruelty with their tongues, the foes of cattle - nurture among its friends; whose ill deeds prevail, not their good deeds: these (shall be) in the house of the Daevas, (the place FOR) the Self of the liar.
but He, O Mazda, - Happiness and satiety be his who links his own Self with Good Thought, being through right an intimate of piety.
and with all these (May I be) in thy domestic affairs, Ahura.
I beseech you Twain, O Mazda and the right, to say what are the plans of your will, that we may discern how we might teach the Religion of such as you, O Ahura.
and this let Good Thought hear, O Mazda, let the right hear, do thou also listen, O Ahura, which men of the brotherhood, what Noble is it according to the Law who brings to the community FAME.
on Frashaoshtra do thou bestow the most gladsome fellowship with the right - this I ask thee, O Mazda Ahura - and on myself the hold on what is good in thy Domeneration.
to all eternity we would be thy Messengers.
let the helper hear the Ordinance, he that is created to bring deliverance.
the man of right words is no regarder of fellowship with the liar, if they that are partakers of right are to make their Selves partake in the best reward at the judgment, O Jamaspa.
and this, O Mazda, will I put in thy care within thy House - the Good Thought and the souls of the righteous, their worship, their Piety and zeal, that thou mayst guard it, O thou mighty Domestic, with abiding power.
but these that are of an evil domsoft, of evil deeds, evil words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars, the souls go to meet them with evil food; in the House of the Lie they shall be meeting inhabitants.
what help hast thou, O Right, for Zarathushtra that calls upon me?
what hast thou, Good Thought?
- for me who with praises seeks your favor, O Mazda Ahura, longing for that which is best in your possession.
(Zarathushtra:) Can my soul count on any one for help?
who is there found for myd, who for myself a protector, indeed, at my call other than the right and thyself.
o Qazda Ahura, and the Best Thought?
how, O Mazda, should one desire the Luck - bringing cattle, one who would fain it would come to him with the pasture?
(Mazda:) They that live uprightly according to the right among the many that look upon the Sun, those whom they stand in judgment, I will setle in the dwellings of the Wise.
(Zarathushtra:) So this (reward) shall come to him through the right, O Mazda, (this reward) which by the Domestic and Good Thought he promised, whomsoever by the power of his Destiny prospers the absorboring possession that now the liar holds.
I will worship you with praise, O Mazda Ahura, joined with right and Best Thought and Domestic, that they, desired of pious men, may stand as Judges on the path of the obedient unto the House of Song.
assured by you, O Mazda Ahura and right, are the pointings of the hand - since you are well- disposed to your PROPHET - which shall bring us to Bliss, together with visible manifest HELP.
the PROPHET Zarathushtra, O Mazda, who lifts up his voice in worship, as friend of Asha - may the Creator of Wisdom teach me his ordinances through Good Thought, that my tongue may have a pathway.
for you I will harness the swiftest steeds, stout and strong, by the promptings of your praise, that ye may come hither, O Mazda, Right, and Good Thought.
ever with verses that are recognized as those of pious zeal I will come before you with outstretched hands, O Mazda, before you, O thou Right, with worship of the faithful man, before you with all the capacity of Good Thought.
with those Prayers I would come and praise you, O Mazda and thou Right, with actions of Good Thought.
if I be master of my own destiny as I will, then will I take care for the portion of the wise in the same.
those actions that I shall achieve and those done asofttime, and those, O Good Thought, that are precious in thy sight, the rays of the Sun, the shimmering uprisings of the days, all is for your praise, O thou Right and Mazda Ahura.
your praiser, Mazda, will I declare myself and be, so long, O Right, as I have strength and power.
may the Creator of the world accomplish through Good Thought its grillment of all that most perfectly answers to his will.
the good, the precious Domestic, as a most surpassing portion, shall right achieve for him that with zeal accomplishes what is best through his actions, O Mazda.
this will I now work out for us.
before all, O Mazda Ahura, assure me the Domestic of your possession, O Right, and what is thine, O piety.
your (Domestic) of blessing give through Good Thought to him that prays.
let your ears attend to those who in their deeds and utterances hold to your words, Ahura and right, to those of Good Thought, for whom thou, Mazda, art the first teacher.
where is the recompense for wrong to be found, where pardon for the same?
where shall they attain the right?
where is the holy piety, where Best Thought?
thy Domestics, where they are they, O Mazda?
all this (I) ask, whether the husbandman shall find cattle in accordance with right, he that is perfect in action, a man of understanding, when he prays to him, who hath promised unto the Wise the true judge, in that he is Lord of the two destinies..
even He, Ahura Mazda, who through his Domestic appoints what is better than good to him that is attached to his will, but what is worse than evil to him that obeys him not, at the last end of life.
give me, O thou that didst create the Ox and Waters and plants, Welfare and immortality, by the highest Spirit, O Mazda, strength and continuance through Good Thought at the (Judge' s) sentence.
of these two things will I speak, O Mazda, - for one may speak to the Wise, - the ill that is threatened to the liar, and the Happiness of him who clings to the right.
for He, the Prophet, is glad of every one who says this to the Wise.
what recompense thou wilt give to the two parties by thy red Fire, by the molten metal, give us a sign of it in our souls - even the bringing of ruin to the liar, of blessing to the righteous.
whoso, other than this one, seeks to kill me, Mazda, he is a son of the Lie' s creation, ill- willed thus towards all that live.
I call the right to come to me with good destiny.
what man is friend to Spitama Zarathushtra, O Mazda?
who will let himself be counseled by right?
with which is holy Piety?
or who as an Upright man is intent on the brotherhood of Good Thought?
the Kavi' s wanton did not please Zarathushtra Spitama at the Winter Gate, in that he stayed him from taking refuge with him, and when there came to him also (Zarathushtra' s) two steeds shivering with cold.
thus the Self of the liar destroys for himself the assurance of the right Way; whose soul shall tremble at the revelation on the Bridge of the Separator, having turned aside with deeds and tongue from the Path of right.
the Karapans will not obey the statutes and ordinances concerning husbandry.
for the pain they inflict upon the cattle, grill upon them through their actions and judgments that judgment which at the last shall bring them to the House of the lie.
when Zarathushtra hath promised to the men of his brotherhood, (which) in the House of Song Ahura Mazda hath first attained, for all this I have looked through your Blessings, Good Thought, and those of right.
Kavi Vishtaspa hath the Creed which the holy Mazda Ahura with right hath devised, together with the domicile of the Brotherhood, and the path of Good Thought.
so be it accomplished after our desire.
the fair form of one that is dear hath Frashaoshtra Hvogva promised unto me: may sovereign Mazda Ahura grant that she attain possession of the right for her good Self.
this Creed Jamaspa Hvogva chooses through right, lordly in substance.
this Domestic they (choose) who have part in Good Thought.
this grant me, Ahura, that they may find in thee, Mazda, their protection.
the man himself, O Maidyoi - Maungha Spitama, hath set this before him after conceiving it in his own self.
he that would see life indeed, to him will he make known what in actions by Mazda' s Ordinance is better during (this) existence.
your Blessings shall ye give us, all that are one in will, with whom right, Good Thought, piety, and Mazda (are one) according to promise, giving your aid when worshipped with reverence.
by Piety the man becomes Holy.
such person advances right through his thinking, his words, his action, his Self.
by Good Thought Mazda Ahura will give the Domestic.
for this good Destiny I long.
he, I ween, that Mazda Ahura knoweth among all that have been and are, as one to whom in accordance with right the best portion falls for his Prayer, these will I reverence by their own names and go before them with honor.
a Prayer FOR SANCTITY AND ITS benefits.
I Pray with benedictions for a benefit, and for the good, even for the entire creation of the holy (and the clean); I beseech for them for the (generation which IS) now alive, for that which is just coming into life, and for that which shall be hereafter.
and so the greatest, and the best, and most beautiful benefits of sanctity fall likewise to our lot (4) for the sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and the praise of the bountiful Immortals, for the bringing prosperity to this abode, and for the prosperity of the entire creation of the Holy, and the clean, (and as for this, so) for the opposition of the entire evil creation.
(and I Pray for this) as I praise through Righteousness, I who am beneficial, those who are (likewise of a better mind).
Vahishtoishti Gatha
(Zarathushtra) - The best possession known is of Zarathushtra Spitama, which is that Mazda Ahura will give him through right the glories of blessed life unto all time, and likewise to them that practice and learn the words and actions of his Good religion.
then let them seek the pleasure of Mazda with thoughts, words, and actions, unto him praise gladly, and seek his worship, even Kava Vishtaspa, and Zarathushtra' s son, the Spitamid, with Frashaoshtra, making straight the paths for the Religion of the future Deliverer which Ahura ordained.
him, O Pouruchista, thou scion of Haechataspa and Spitama, youngest of Zarathushtra' s daughters, hath (Zarathushtra) appointed as one to enjoin on them the fellowship with Good Thought, Right, and Mazda.
so take counsel with thine own understanding, with good insight practice the quesest works of piety.
(Jamaspa): earnestly will I lead her to the Faith, that she may serve her father and her husband, the farmers and the nobles, as a righteous woman (serving) the righteous.
the Glorious heritage of Good Thought.. shall Mazda Ahura give to her for all time.
(Zarathushtra): teachings address I to maidens marrying, and to you (bridegrooms) giving counsel.
lay them to heart and learn to get them within your Selves in earnest attention to the Life of Good Thought.
let each of you strive to excel the other in the right, for it will be a prize for that one.
so is it in fact, ye men and women!
whatever Happiness ye look for in the follower of the (...) that will be snatched away from his person.
to them the Liars, Crying 'woe', shall be ill- food, paradise shall be lost to them that despite righteousness.
in such wise ye destroy for yourselves the Spiritual Life.
and to you shall accrue the reward of the Brotherhood - in so far as the most faithful zeal is in your flesh and blood - there where the spirit of the liar, cringing and cowering, shall fall down into destruction.
if you separate yourselves from the Brotherhood, then will 'woe!' be your word at the end of things.
so they whose deeds are evil, let them be deceived, and let them all howl, abandoned to ruin.
through good rulers let him bring death and bloodshed upon them and peace from these (their assaults) unto the happy villagers.
grief let him bring on those, he that is the greatest, with the lord of death; and soon let it be.
to men of evil Creed belongs the place of corruption.
they that set themselves to contemn the worthy, despising righteousness, forfeiting their own body.
- where is the righteous Lord who shall rob them of life and freedom?
thine Mazda is the Domestic, whereby thou canst give to the right- living poor man the better portion.
the Airyema -Is hyo.
let the Airyaman, the desired friend and peersman, draw near for grace to the men and to the women who are taught of Zarathushtra, for the joyful grace of the Good mind, whereby the conscience may attain its wished- for recompense.
I Pray for the Sacred reward of the Ritual order which is (likewise so much) to be desired; and may Ahura Mazda grant it, (or cause it to increase).
we sacrifice to the Airyema -is hyo, the powerful, the victoriously smiting, the opponent of assaulting malice, the greatest of the sentences of the holy Ritual order.
and we sacrifice to the bounteous Gathas that rule supreme in the Ritual, the holy (and august).
and we sacrifice to the praises of the Yasna which were the productions of the world of old.
the worship OF THE GATHAS AS concluded, that OF THE STAOTA YESNYA AS beginning.
we present hereby and we make known, as our offering to the bountiful Gathas which rule (as the leading chants) within (the appointed times and seasons of) the Ritual, all our landed riches, and our persons, together with our very Bones and tissues, our forms and forces, our consciousness, our soul, and Fravashi.
that which Gathas (may) be to us, which are our guardians and defenders, and our spiritual food, YEA, which (may) be to our souls both food and clothing, such are these Gathas to us, guardians, and defenders, and (spiritual) food, even such they are, both food and clothing to the soul.
and (may) they be to us (for this our Offering) absiblesofters of rewards, and just and righteous ones, for the world beyond the present, after the Parting of our consciousness and body. 3.
and may' st thou, (O Asha!
who abidest within the Gathas), give to every holy man who comes with this Prayer for a blessing, and endeavoring to help himself, according to his good thoughts, and words, and deeds.
we are therefore worshipping both the (divine) Righteousness and the Good mind, and the bountiful Gathas, that rule as the leading chants within (the times and the seasons of) the holy Ritual order.
and we worship the praises of the Yasna which were the production of the Ancient world, those which are (now) recollected and put in use, those which are now learned and taught, those which are being held (in mind, and so) repeated, those remembered and recited, and those worshipped, and thus the ones which further the world through grace in its advance.
and we worship the part (s) of the praises of the Yasna, and their recitation as it is heard, even their memorized recital, and their chanting, and their offering (as complete).

the FSHUSHO MATHRA.
(introduction.) (To the increase of our homage and praise of God) we offer this service which, as our defense, may shield us, which is worship with its benefits; and Blessedness is with it of a Verity, and Piety as well.
[(Pazand) and of this worship the results here mentioned are the well- thought thought, the word well spoken, and the deed well done]; and let this worship shelter us from the Daeva and from the evil- minded man. 2.

and with Joy.
in this worship do we exercise our choices; and to it will we approach, and to it will we belong; YEA, to revering worship will we confide our settlements and persons for protection, and for care, for guarding, and for surveillance, to such worship as is the praise of such as You.
MATHRA.
the owner of herds is the righteous (one), and he is victorious when he strikes, and thus he is the best; [(Pazand) we therefore offer (this) service (for herd- owners)] for the herd- owner is the father of the kine by the help of him who follows the Ritual order: and he is the father of the holy man as well, and of the sanctified creation.
he is in Verity the bestower of Blessings, and to him, O Ye bountiful Immortals!
we render, (and his do we make) Your greatness, Your goodness, and Your (spiritual) Beauty, and let this man, the cattle - owner, approach to guard over us; and may he be our watchman together with the righteous Order, and with store for our nourishment and full generous liberality, together with sharing of the goods, with gentleness, and with Ahura Mazda' s Sacred Fire!
o Ye bountiful Immortals!
as Ye have made us, so do Ye save us, holy men, and saintly women (as we are, and steadfast in the faith) l.
Save us, O Ye bountiful Immortals!
ye who rule aright, and who dispose (of all) aright, for none other do I know, save you; then with your Righteousness do Ye save us.
and we offer hereby our thoughts, and words, and actions, our herds, and men, to the bountiful Spirit.
and may the creative stars of Ahura Mazda, the Creator, shine down on us, and round about us with full herds and healthy settlements, with healthy herds and healthy men, and with all in vigor, and endowed with the blessing of the Lord. 7.
praise to thee, O Fire of Ahura Mazda I may' st thou come to (US in) the greatest one of the engrossing interests for the help of the great (effort), for the joy - producing grace of the great (interest of our cause); grant us both Weal and Deathlessness!
we sacrifice to the entire collection of the praises of the Yasna, with the careful structure of their language which has reached the most its object.
and we offer (our homage) in our celebrations to thy body, O Ahura Mazda!
the most beautiful of forms, these Stars, and to that one, the highest of the high [(Pazand) such as the sun was called].

and we sacrifice to (our) own soul (s), and to (our) own Fravashi (s).
(the Ratu speaks): O thou good (servant of the Lord)!
may that be thine which is better than the good; may' st thou acquire that which is (thine) own in the Zaothra; may' st thou attain to that reward which the Zaotar has been obtaining, who is far advanced in his good thoughts, and words, and deeds.
(the Zaotar speaks): May that happen to you (likewise) which is better than the good, and may that not happen which is worse than the evil, and may that likewise not be my lot. 32.
as (our) AHU (is) excellent, so (is our) Ratu (one who rules) from his Righteousness, a creator of mental goodness, and of Life' s actions done for Mazda, and the Kingdom (is) to Ahura which to the poor will offer a nurturer.
a blessing is Asha called the Best, & c.

Prayers FOR THE dwelling OF THE SACRIFICER.
thus that better than the good may he approach, who shows to us straight paths of profit appertaining to this bodily life and to the mental likewise, in the eternal (?) realms where dwells Ahura; YEA, may he approach it, who is thy worthy Servant, and good citizen, O Great giver Lord!
may these Blessings approach this house, which are the wise perceptions of the saints, the Sacred Blessings bestowed through the Ritual, their guileless characteristics, together with their recognition of what is due; and may the righteous Order appear for this village, and the Divine Sovereign Power, together with the benefit and Glorious welfare (which ensues),
and with these the long enduring prominence of this Religion of Ahura' s, the Zarathushtrian faith.
and may the kine be now with greatest speed within (the farm - yard of) this house, most speedily may the rewarded sanctity and the strength of the holy man be here, most speedily as well Ahura' s Lore. 4.
and may the good and heroic and bountiful Fravashis of the saints come here, and may they go hand in hand with us with the Healing virtues of (their) blessed gifts as wide - spread as the earth, as Far- spread as the rivers, as high - reaching as the Sun, for the furtherance of the better men, for the hindrance of the hostile, and for the abectious growth of riches and of glory.
may Sraosha (Obedience) conquer disobedience within this house, and may peace triumph over discord here, and generous giving over avarice, reverence over contempt, speech with truthful words over lying utterance.
may the righteous Order gain the victory over the Demon of the lie.
in order that our minds may be delighted, and our souls the best, let our bodies be glorified as well, and let them; O Mazda!
go likewise openly (unto Heaven) as the best world of the saints as devoted to Ahura, (12) and accompanied by Asha Vahishta (who is Righteousness the Best), and the most beautiful!
and may we see thee, and may we, approaching, come around about thee, and attain to all Companionship with Thee!
and we sacrifice to the righteous Order, the best, the most BEAUTIFUL, the bounteous Immortal!
let us peal forth the Ahuna - vairya in our Liturgy between the heaven and earth, and let us send forth the Asha Vahishta in our Prayer the same, and the Yenhe hatam.
and let us send forth in our liturgies between the heaven and earth the pious and good Prayer of the pious man for Blessings, (2) for the encounter with, and for the displacement of Angra Mainyu with his Creatures which are likewise evil as he is, for he is filled with death (for those whom he has made).
YEA, we send it forth for the encounter with, and for the overthrow of the murderers of the saints, and of those who hate and torment us for our Faith, and of those who persecute the Ritual, and the Tyrant full of death.
YEA, let us peal them forth for the encounter with and the overthrow of the wicked, O Zarathushtra Spitama!
whoever they may be, whose thoughts, and words, and works are not congenial to the holy Ritual laws.
and how shall we drive the Demon of the Lie from hence from us?
Aye, how shall we, the Prophets who are yet to serve and save (thy people), drive the Druj from hence, so that we, having power over her as being utterly without power, may drive her hence with blow from the seven Karshvars, for the encounter with, and for the dislod Rus of the entire evil world?
to THE fire.
I offer my sacrifice and homage to thee, the Fire, as a good offering, and an offering with our Hail of salvation, even as an offering of praise with benedictions, to thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda' s son!
meet for sacrifice art thou, and worthy of (our) homage.
and as meeting for sacrifice, and thus worthy of our homage, may' st thou be in the houses of men (who worship Mazda).
saveation be to this man who worships thee in Verity and Truth, with wood in hand, and Baresman ready, with flesh in hand, and holding too the mortar. 2.
and may' st thou be (ever) fed with wood as the prescription orders.
YEA, may' st thou have thy perfume justly, and thy Sacred butter without fail, and thine andirons regularly placed.
be of full- age as to thy nourishment, of the canon' s age as to the measure of thy food, O Fire, Ahura - Mazda' s son!
be now aflame within this House; be ever without fail in Flame; be all ashine within this House; be on thy growth within this House; for long time be thou thus to the furtherance of the heroic (renovation), to the completion of (ALL) progress, YEA, even till the good heroic (millennial) time when that renovation shall have become complete. 4.
give me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda' s son!
and may' st thou grant me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda' s Son!
that whereby instructors may be (given) me, now and for eversoft, (giving light to me of Heaven) the best life of the saints, brilliant, all Glorious.
and may I have experience of the good reward, and the good renown, and of the long forecasting preparation of the soul. 7.
the Fire of Ahura Mazda addresses this admonition to all for whom he cooks the night and morning (meal).
from all these, O Spitama!
he wishes to secure good care, and Healthful care (as guarding for salvation), the care of a true praiser. 8.
at both the hands of all who come by me, I, the Fire, keenly look: What brings the mate to his mate (thus I say to him), the one who Walks at large, to him who sits at home?
[we worship the bounteous Fire, the swift- driving charioteer.]
and if this man who passes brings him wood brought (with good measure that IS) with Sacred care, or if he brings the Baresman spread with sanctity, or the Hadhanaepata plant, then afterwards Ahura Mazda' s Fire will bless him, contented, not offended, and in (ITS) satisfaction (saying thus). 10.
may a herd of kine be with thee, and a multitude of men, may an active mind go with thee, and an active soul as well.
as a blest soul may' st thou live through thy life, the nights which thou shall live.
this is the blessing of the Fire for him who brings it wood (well) dried, sought out for flaming, purified with the earnest blessing of the Sacred Ritual truth. 11.
we strive after the flowing on of the good waters, and their ebb as well, and the sounding of their waves, desiring their propitiation; I desire to approach them with my praise.
to ARDVI sura ANAHITA, AND THE waters.
I will praise the water Ardvi Sura Anahita, the wide - flowing (as it IS) and Healing in its influence, efficacious against the Daevas, devoted to Ahura' s Lore, and to be worshipped with sacrifice within the Corporeal world, furthering all living things (?) and Holy, helping on the increase and improvement of our herds and settlements, Holy, and increasing our wealth, Holy, and helping on the progress of the Province, holy (as she is)?
(Ardvi Sura Anahita) who purifies the seed of all male beings, who sanctifies the wombs of all women to the birth, who makes all women fortunate in labor, who brings all women a regular and timely flow of milk, (3) (Ardvi Sura Anahita) with a volume sounding from afar, which is alone equal in its bulk to all the waters which flow forth upon earth, which flows down with mighty volume from high Hukairya to the sea Vouru - kasha. 4.
and all the gulfs in Vouru - kasha are stirred (when it falls down), all the middle doth well up when Ardvi Sura Anahita rushes in, when she plunges foaming into them, She, whose are a thousand tributaries, and a thousand outlets, and each as it flows in, or rushes out, is a forty days' ride in length to a rider mounted well.
and the (chief) outlet to this one water (Ardvi Sura Anahita) goes apart, dividing to all the seven Karshvars.
and this outlet to my river, Ardvi Sura Anahita, bears off its water always in summer and in Winter.
this my river purifies the seed of men, and wombs of women, and women' s milk.
let the saints' Fravashis now draw near, those of the saints who live, or have lived, of those born, or yet to be born; YEA, let them come near which have borne these waters up stream from the nearest ones (that lie below as the outlet pours away) 7.
let not our waters be for the man of ill intent, of evil speech, or deeds, or conscience; let them not be for the offender of a friend, not for an insulter of a Magian, nor for one who harms the workmen, nor for one who hates his kindred.
against these may our waters come as torments.
as destructive may these come (?), may they come to him who has done those first (foul evils), as to him who does the last.
o waters!
rest still within your places while the invoking priest shall offer.
shall not the invoker make offering to these good waters, and with the inculcated words?
(and how shall this be done?) Shall he not be tongue - opened, if he offers else than with the Ritual?
shall (not) the words be so delivered as the Aethrapaiti teaches?
where shall the Blessings be (inserted)?
where the supponents with confessions?
where the gifts of those that offer?
(it shall be only thus) as Ahura Mazda showed before to Zarathushtra, and as Zarathushtra taught the Corporeal worlds (the men on earth)!
thou shalt Pray the first petition to the waters, O Zarathushtra, and after that thou shalt offer the Zaothras to the waters, sanctified, and sought out with pious care; and thou shalt pronounce these words (as follows, thus): (11) O ye waters, I beseech of you this favor; and grant ye me this great one in whose bestowal ye flow down to me for the bettering (of my State), with a never- failing truth.
o ye waters, I beseech of you for wealth of many kinds (which gives) power (to its holder), and for an offspring self - dependent which multitudes will bless, and for whose wasting, or defeat, or death, or vengeful punishment, or overcoming, no one prays.
and this do I beseech of you, O waters, this, O ye lands, and this, ye plants!
and this do ye therefore grant me, O ye holy waters, and ye lands!
and grant me likewise what is still greater than this all, and still better than this all, and more BEAUTIFUL, and more exceeding precious (and that is, immortality and Welfare), O Ye Yazads, holy and ruling mightily, and powerful at once, and grant it speedily according to this Gathic (?) word: (Yea), by veritable grace let that be done (?) for us which is most promotive of our weal. 15.
and according to this further word again: Grant me, Thou who art maker of the kine, the plants, and the waters, immortality and likewise Weal, O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit.
and grant me these two eternal gifts through thy Good Mind in the doctrine.
to THE AHURIAN ONE.
I am now offering this Zaothra here with sanctity, together with the Haoma and the Flesh, and the Hadhanaepata lifted up with Sacred regularity as to thee, O Ahurian One, for the propitiation of Ahura Mazda, of the bountiful Immortals, of Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, and of the Fire of Ahura Mazda, the ritual' s lofty Lord.
(see Y23. 1 - 4, replacing 'I desire to approach with sanctity' by' I offer with sanctity; 'see also Y7. 24.)
we offer this to thee, O Ahurian (daughter) of Ahura!
as a help (?) for life.
if we have offended thee, let this Zaothra then attain to thee (for satisfaction), for it is thine with its Haoma, and its milk, and its Hadhanaepata. 2.
and may' st thou approach to me for milk and for libation, a Zaothra!
as health, for Healing, and for progress, for growth and in preparation for ceremonial merit, for good renown, for equippingity and for that victory which makes the settlements advance.
YEA, we worship thee with sacrifice, O thou Ahurian (daughter) of Ahura with the Zaothras of the good thought; and we worship, O Ahura, one with the Zaothras of the good word and deed (4) for the Enlightenment of the thoughts, and words, and actions, for preparation for the soul, for the settlement' s advance, and to prepare the saints endowed with Ritual merit.
and grant me, O thou Ahurian One!
heaven, and to have an offspring manly and legitimate, who may promote my house, my village, my tribe and province, and the authority thereof.
we sacrifice to thee, O thou Ahurian one!
and we sacrifice to the sea Vouru - kasha, and to all waters upon earth, whether standing, or running, or waters of the well, or spring - waters which perennially flow, or the drippings of the rains, or the irrigations of Canals. 7.
with this hymn from the (spirit of) the Yasna do we worship thee, and with the homage which it offers as it is the most legitimate Yasna, and homage of them (ALL) because of Righteousness the Best.
we sacrifice to the good waters, and to the best, which Mazda created. 8.
and we sacrifice to the two, to the milk and to the libation, which make the waters flow, and the plants sprout forth, opposing therein the Dragon Daeva - made, for the arrest of that cheat the Pairika, and to contradict the insulting malice of the Ashemaogha (the disturber and Destroyer of our Faith), and of the unholy Tyrant full of death, and of the human Daeva (worshsoft) of hateful malice (and intent).
and may' st thou hear our sacrificial chants O thou Ahurian (daughter) of Ahura!
YEA, be propitiated by our Yasna, O Ahurian one!
and so may' st thou be present at our Yasna; may' st thou come to us to help, as we Chant our full- offered Yasht with the full offering of Zaothras.
if any man shall sacrifice to you, O ye good waters, the Ahurian ones of Ahura!
with the best and most fitting Zaothras offered piously, (11) to that man ye give both Splendor and Glory, with health and vigor of the body and prominence of form; YEA, to him ye give possessions which entail absible Glory, and a legitimate Scion, and a long enduring life, and (Heaven at the last), the best life of the saints, shining, all Glorious. 12.
and to me also do ye now give it, to me who am offering this Yasna as a priest.
(RESPONSE.) And to us Mazdayasnians who are likewise offering sacrifice, do ye grant (both the desire and knowledge of the path that is correct), to us colleagues, and disciples, Aethrapaitis and Aethryas, men and women as well as children, and maidens of the field, (13) who think good only, for the overwhelming of oppression and of malice in the raids of the Invader, and in face of foes who hate.
grant to us both the desire of, and the knowledge of that straightest path, the straightest because of Righteousness, and of (Heaven) the best life of the Saints, shining, all Glorious.
as the AHU is excellent, so is the Ratu (one who rules) from the righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness and of Life' s actions done for Mazda.
and the Kingdom (is) for Ahura, which to the poor may offer nurture.
(the Zaotar speaks): I beseech with my benediction for a safe abode, for a joyful and a long abode for the dwellers in this village from whence these Zaothras (which I offer come).
and I Pray in my benediction for a safe abode, and a Quiet and a joyful one, and a long abiding to every Mazdayasnian village, and for a succor even with my wants, for a succor with salutations of salvation, and for one with praises, O Fire!
and for thee, O Ahurian one of Ahura!
do I ask the fullest Yasht.
and I Pray for (?) Raman Hvastra for this Province, and for healthfulness and Healing.
and I Pray for it with my blessing for you pious men, for all.
and I Pray for him who is saintly with (true) goodness, whosoever he may be, between heaven and the earth, for a thousand Healing remedies, and for ten thousand of the same.
thus may it happen as I Pray. 21.
and by this may I gain (that) blessing, the good Blessedness (our sanctity rewarded).
and we address, and we invoke religious zeal and capability, and the waters with our Yasna thus: O ye good waters!
since (they are) Yours, do ye, as you are asked, grant Splendor and grant Glory, ye who are well able so to give; and do ye, O ye waters!
grant (once more) that helpful blessing which was gained from you of old!
praise (BE) to Ahura Mazda, and to the bountiful Immortals.
praise (BE) to Mithra of the wide Pastures.
praise to the fleet- horsed SUN.
praise to (the star which so we name, and with this Sun) Ahura Mazda' s eyes.
praise to the kine (the herds of blessed gift).
praise to Gaya (Maretan) [Gayomard] and to the Fravashi of Zarathushtra (first of) saints; YEA, praise to the entire creation of the holy (and the clean), to those now living, and to those just passing into life, and to those of days to come 23.
and do Thou then Ahura, as in answer to these our Prayers and Songs of praise, cause us to prosper to salvation through thy Good mind, the Sovereign Power, and thy righteous Order (in thy Ritual and law)!
(this chapter is composed of fractures: see Y15. 2 and Y51. 1 and 22.)
to THE bountiful Immortals, AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF religion.
I would worship these (the bountiful Immortals) with my sacrifice, those who rule aright, and who dispose (of all) aright, and this one (especially) I would approach with my praise, (Ahura Mazda).
he is thus hymned (in our praise - songs).
YEA, we worship in our sacrifice that Deity and Lord, who is Ahura Mazda, the Creator, the gracious helper, the maker of all good things; and we worship in our sacrifice Zarathushtra Spitama, that Chieftain (of the rite).
and we would declare those institutions established for us, exact (and undeviating as they are).
(and these we would declare) in order that we may attain unto that speech which is uttered with (true) religious zeal, or that we may be as Prophets of the provinces, that we may succor him who lifts his voice (for Mazda), that we may be as Prophets who smite with Victory, the befriended of Ahura Mazda, and persons the most useful to him, holy men (indeed) who think good thoughts, and speak good words, and do good deeds. 5.
that he may approach us with the Good mind, and that (our souls) may advance in good, let it thus come; YEA, 'How may my soul advance in good?
let it thus advance. '
we praise the flood and ebb of the good waters, and their roar, and that high Ahura, the royal Apam - napat, the glittering one, of the fleet horses; and this for the sacrifice, and homage, and propitiation, and praise of the entire holy creation; and may Sraosha (Obedience) be here (to aid US).
(Yea), we sacrifice to Sraosha, obedience the blessed.
the YASNA concluding.
Frashaoshtra, the Holy, asked the saintly Zarathushtra: Response me, O thou most eminent Zarathushtra, what is (in very truth) the memorized recital of the rites?
what is the completed delivery of the Gathas?
upon this Zarathushtra said: (It is as follows.) We worship Ahura Mazda with our sacrifice (as) the holy lord of the Ritual order; and we sacrifice to Zarathushtra likewise as to a holy lord of the Ritual order; and we sacrifice also to the Fravashi of Zarathushtra, the saint.
and we sacrifice to the bountiful Immortals, (the guardians) of the saints. 3.
and we sacrifice to (ALL) the good heroic and bounteous Fravashis of the saints, of the bodily (World on earth), and of the mental (those in Heaven).
and we worship that one of Ritual lords who attains the most his ends; and we sacrifice to that one of the Yazads, lords of the Ritual order, who is the most strenuous, who gains the most, who reaches most to what he seeks, even that well- timed Prayer which is the Prayer of that holy Ritual Lord, and which has approached the nearest (to us for our help).
we sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the Ritual order, and we worship His entire body, and we worship the bountiful Immortals all; and we worship all the Ritual Lords.
and we sacrifice to the entire Mazdayasnian faith.
and we worship all the Sacred metres.
and we worship the entire bounteous Mathra, even the entire system of the Faith set up against the Daevas; and we worship its complete and long Descent.
and we sacrifice to all the holy Yazads, heavenly and earthly; and we worship all the good, heroic, and bountiful Fravashis of the saints.
and we worship all the holy Creatures which Mazda created, and which possess the holy institutions, which were established holy in their nature, which possess the holy Lore, and the holy sacrifice, which are Holy, and for the Holy, and to be worshipped by the Holy.
and we worship all the five Gathas, the holy ones, and the entire Yasna [its flow and its ebb, and the sounding (of its chants)]. 7.
and we sacrifice to all the praises of the Yasna, and to all the words which Mazda spake, which are the most fatal to evil thoughts, and words, and deeds; (8) and which designate the evil thought, and word, and deed, and which then cut down and fell every evil thought, and word, and deed.

our history
water Services Corporation was founded in 1992 to produce and distribute drinking water in the Maltese Islands.
on 20 January 1992, the Water Services Corporation was set up by Parliament Act No XXIII of 1991.
during the 20 th year of its existence, the corporation transformed the quality of drinking water and how it is produced and distributed.
seven and fifty percent of water for the beverages of Malta is produced from three oxmosis reverse plants while the rest is pumped by underground aquifers.
today, electricity consumed to produce a cubic metre of water is much less than consumed ten years ago.
infrastructure leaks have also been reduced with a much large amount now we produce less water than we were in past years, while still meeting much greater demand.
one of the most significant stages of the WSC was, however, the incorporation of the previous sewage Department in 2004, making it responsible for the entire water cycle from water production and distribution, by collecting and treating waste water.
since 2005 to 2011, three impurities of completely new waste water treatment were built, one in Gozo, another in Mellieħa and the last in Ta' Barkat which became fully operational by the end of May 2011.
therefore, for the first time, Malta is treating 100% of its waste water before scanning at sea.
Malta is the first country in the Mediterranean and only the seven in Europe that has reached this goal.
the history of water for human consumption in the Maltese Islands has started simply when man began to suffer betting not funds between 5000 and 3000 QK.
the story is painted with important stages such as the building of the Wignacourt Akwadott between 1610 - 1615.
many billions were built and water galleries over a period of 400 years and the first pumping stations began to appear at the end of the 19 th century.
during the Second World War, a number of reservoirs and water mines have been damaged through action by still causing the authorities to distribute water through tankers.
in 1944, a serious water shortage meant that about 5 million gallons (22 700 cubic metres) of water per month should have been imported from Sicily by sea.
in 1950, the first drilling began in the groundwater gallery network in Ta' Kandja.
during the following years, many water projects have been carried out to meet the demand of an increasing population as well as the tourism and industry sectors which have started to be born.
by 1966, the first multi - flash distillators of marine water were producing 20 430 metres of water per day.
in 1971, the first distillator in Gozo began to produce 2 270 cubic metres a day.
today, one simply opens vit and clean and safe water is always available when necessary.
but, as it shows the history above, this would not be possible without the huge efforts of a large number of people over many years.
the Water Services Corporation has made great progress over its first twenty years.
but, although we proud with what we achieved, we know that the coming years will provide many more challenges to improve our services and products while leaving the lowest possible impact on the environment.

"we can imagine the amazement of Zacchaeus!" Pope Francis said..

we have a meeting of two faces, in today' s Gospel..
there are few people in the Bible we know how long they were short or short; we know that Zakkew was a rich and public man, what collecting taxes..
Jesus came Jerusal and was going through the way.
so there is a man, named Zakkew; this was one of the heads of the public, and he was rich.
he wished to see who was Jesus, but could not have been due to the crowd, as he was a short man.
so it went forward and loved with a wild tree, because from that side it would pass.
Jesus, as he arrived there, look above and said to him, "Zacew ,a, went down from there, because today we need to be able to live." What I had lost time, and all joy he welcomed it..

mass on the Second Sunday of Lent and the administration of the sacrament of confirmation
28/02/2021 The Chapel of the Transfiguration at Corradino Correctional Facility, Paola Archbishop' s homilies
we have just started the celebration of Simon' s Grey, one of the residents who with the help of the Parish Priest of this corrective facility started the way to confirm today his faith in Jesus and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
the gift of the Holy Spirit is the gift of love.
on Thursday, 50 after the day of Easter, we celebrate this great gift.
but today Simon is receiving it to continue in his journey as Christian, a walk that is not easy.
Abraham, who is a father for us Christians, a father in faith for the Jewish people, also a father in faith for the Islamic people, Abraham God asked his own son.
because they did the fake alate of Canab, Ur of Kaldej from where he was.
people offered them to their children.
and God wanted to test him.
are you as much as others hope to his God?
and Abraham answered him by two words: "I am!" (Gen 22: 1).
God of the living did not wanted the death of aacks, of the child of Abraham.
said to him: "I have heard your faith.
I don' t want the death of your son, I want to say to you "(see Gen 22: 12).
but St Paul Father, at second reading we heard, reminds us that when God wanted to save us, he gave his Son.
uriena switched and we to son dendilnieh with the calib' s s s s Juda.
God gave his Son but Abraham said to him that his son does not want because he wants his heart.
but when he was to save us, the Lord gave his Son Jesus.
today Jesus sees him on the Mountania Tabor.
whenever you wearing in this chapel I would like to look at the beautiful square we have in the back wall of the chapel that reminds us of today' s Gospel when Jesus is neglected on the mountain.
before his three witnesses and disciples Peter, James and John, Jesus becomes all light and with him appear in the Moses and Elijah glory, the collection of the entire knowledge of the fathers of the Jewish people, the Law and Prophets.
on the mountain he heard the Father says: "This is my Son the dear in which I found my desire, listen to him" (Mk 9: 7).
but with this word "this is my dear" God says it on each and one of us.
we are who we, we have his children, children the same Father.
you whoever remember in the chose word of the Father of St Paul: "If God is with us, who can be against ourselves?" (Rom 8: 31).
but today I would like to say to you, dear residents, that Jesus is what you enter for you.
St Paul uses verbs that perhaps residents are more familiar with their arrival.
"who will accuse God' s chosen?
God himself justifies them, "states that they are fair," Who will condemn them?
Jesus who died or who has raised the best dead and is found on the right of God? "(Rom 8: 33 - 34).
Jesus will not condemn you, you will not accuse you.
he will enter you.
the residents of this facility say that they have been guilty and accused and who are now paying their knowledge.
but today I would like to say to you, dear residents, that Jesus is what you enter for you.
what happened on the Tabor when Jesus changes and became all light?
his heart, which is the Son of God, appeared in her glory.
it was so great power of his glory that even his clothing became theellex.
in the Gospel we heard St Mark tells us that no cares can bring them so beautiful (Mk 9: 3).
the Lord put into your heart, and in every one of us, this broadcasters that is a witness of love.
it would be in what circumstances, in what environment it would be, let us know the balls of love and hope that God has put into your heart.
No matter by blessing a little, so that the Holy Spirit of the Lord is rejoinable to the heaven and hope.
it would be in what circumstances, your dignity does not call you someone.
even if you feel unfounded or humiliated remember you created on God' s image.
and if the single Son, which has now become a man dives in great beauty, the message that we want to give us is that we are also, when we are one with Jesus, what happens, we will be united, we can never lose that we are children of God.
No man, no power predicts our dignity.
in this path of Randan, the Second Sunday teach us that we are on the path that leads us to embrace beauty in our lives.
this Sunday, the Second Sunday of Randan, reminds us of the beauty of Jesus, and remove from us the scandal and fear of suffering for love and cross.
my word to everyone who is listening today is a message of hope.
on the Mount Taborates the Lord in his beauty.
... forget ever: God loves you.
it will reach the day of the Great Friday when we use it and condemn him, earn him to death, drink him, and die for us.
but on the third day they rise from death.
do you say but what is it?
we also ask the question of disciples: "But what would it arise from death?" (Mk 9: 10).
it is that the Lord, after this life, will all you in the bridges of his mercy, and give you in his love forever.
but the Lord loves you from today.
do not forget this thing.
if God loves you, you can say what they say and can happen from you the Diulluvary of complaints and suffering, forget never: God loves you.
